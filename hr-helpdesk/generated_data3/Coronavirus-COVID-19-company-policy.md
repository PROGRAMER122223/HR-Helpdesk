## Policy Provisions

### Health Monitoring and Reporting

*   **Symptom Reporting:** Employees experiencing symptoms such as fever, cough, shortness of breath, or other signs of illness are required to report to their manager and refrain from coming to the office. They should utilize available sick leave or discuss remote work options.
*   **Positive Diagnosis:** In the event of a confirmed positive diagnosis for a communicable illness, employees must isolate as per public health guidelines. Return to the workplace will require medical clearance confirming full recovery and absence of contagiousness.
*   **Close Contact Notification:** Employees who have been in close contact with an individual diagnosed with a communicable illness should notify their manager and follow recommended quarantine and testing protocols.

### Remote Work and Flexible Arrangements

*   **Illness-Related Remote Work:** Employees who are mildly unwell but able to perform their duties may request to work remotely, subject to manager approval.
*   **Travel-Related Remote Work:** Employees returning from international travel or travel to regions with high prevalence of specific illnesses may be required to work remotely for a designated period and monitor for symptoms.
