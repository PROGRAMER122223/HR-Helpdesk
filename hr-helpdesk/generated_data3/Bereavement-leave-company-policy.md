# Acme Corp - Compassionate Leave Policy

## Policy Overview & Purpose

Acme Corp recognizes that employees may experience the profound loss of a loved one. This policy outlines the provisions for compassionate leave, designed to offer support and allow employees the necessary time to grieve, attend to personal matters, and make arrangements during such difficult periods. We aim to provide a supportive environment that acknowledges the emotional impact of bereavement.

## What is Compassionate Leave?

Compassionate leave, also known as bereavement leave, is a designated period of absence granted to employees following the death of a family member or close associate. This leave may be paid or unpaid, as detailed within this policy, and is intended to provide practical and emotional respite.

## Scope

### Definition of Immediate Family and Close Associates

For the purposes of this policy, "immediate family" includes:

*   Spouse or registered domestic partner
*   Parents (biological, adoptive, foster, or legal guardians)
*   Children (biological, adoptive, foster, or legal guardians)
*   Siblings
*   Grandparents and grandchildren
*   In-laws of the same degree (parents-in-law, siblings-in-law, children-in-law)
*   Step-relatives and half-relatives

In addition to immediate family, Acme Corp also extends compassionate leave provisions to employees experiencing the loss of a **close friend**. We understand that the impact of such a loss can be significant, and employees will be granted leave to attend memorial services or to grieve.

## Policy Provisions

Acme Corp provides a standard compassionate leave of **up to three (3) working days** per instance of death. This leave is intended to be used for:

*   Making funeral or memorial service arrangements.
*   Attending funeral or memorial services.
*   Addressing immediate personal or family obligations arising from the loss.
*   Personal mourning and reflection.

Employees who need to travel a significant distance (over 500 kilometers) for the purpose of attending a funeral or memorial service, or to support family, may be granted an additional **two (2) working days** of leave.

For complex estate or inheritance matters, employees may request an extension of **up to one (1) week of unpaid leave**. If further time off is required beyond the provisions of this policy, employees are encouraged to utilize their accrued Paid Time Off (PTO) or explore other leave options in consultation with HR.

## Compensation During Compassionate Leave

The standard compassionate leave of up to three (3) working days will be **paid leave**, with employees receiving their regular salary or wages. Any additional leave granted beyond the standard provision, including extended travel leave or unpaid leave for estate matters, will be unpaid unless the employee opts to use their accrued PTO.

## Procedure for Requesting Compassionate Leave

Employees requiring compassionate leave should notify their immediate manager and the Human Resources department as soon as reasonably possible. This notification can be made via email or through the company's designated HR portal.

While Acme Corp generally does not require formal documentation for standard compassionate leave, proof of travel or other supporting documents may be requested for extended leave requests.

Managers are expected to handle compassionate leave requests with sensitivity and in accordance with this policy. Failure to appropriately support an employee's request for compassionate leave may result in disciplinary action.
