# Acme Corp - Paid Time Off Policy

## Policy Overview and Objective

This Paid Time Off (PTO) Policy establishes Acme Corp's framework for employee time off, encompassing holidays, personal leave, and vacation. The objective is to promote a healthy work-life balance, ensure fair compensation for time off, and provide clear guidelines for its administration.

## Applicability

This policy applies to all full-time and part-time employees of Acme Corp. Specific provisions may differ based on employment status (e.g., permanent vs. contract) and will be detailed within this document. Employees covered by a separate collective bargaining agreement will adhere to the terms outlined in that agreement.

## Policy Components

Acme Corp recognizes the following public holidays:

*   **New Year's Day** (January 1st)
*   **Republic Day** (January 26th)
*   **Holi** (Date varies)
*   **Good Friday** (Date varies)
*   **Id-ul-Fitr** (Date varies)
*   **Independence Day** (August 15th)
*   **Dussehra** (Date varies)
*   **Diwali** (Date varies)
*   **Christmas Day** (December 25th)

In addition to these designated holidays, Acme Corp offers employees a set number of **Personal Leave Days** annually, which can be utilized for personal reasons, appointments, or other needs not covered by vacation or sick leave. Unused Personal Leave Days do not typically carry over to the next calendar year.

When a designated public holiday falls on a weekend (Saturday or Sunday), the preceding Friday or following Monday, respectively, will be observed as the official holiday. HR will communicate any such adjustments to all employees via official company channels and update relevant HR systems.

Employees working a compressed work schedule who miss a designated holiday due to their schedule may be eligible for an alternative day off. Such requests must be formally submitted to their direct manager and the HR department for approval.

### Working on a Designated Holiday

In instances where business needs necessitate employees working on a designated holiday:

*   Employees will be provided with at least **seven (7) days' notice** if their presence is required.
*   Non-exempt employees required to work on a holiday will receive their standard hourly rate plus a **premium pay of 1.5 times their regular rate** for hours worked on the holiday. Overtime hours worked beyond the holiday will be compensated according to the company's overtime policy.
*   Exempt employees required to work on a holiday will be granted an **additional compensatory day off**, which must be taken within **six (6) months** of the holiday.
*   Hours worked on a designated holiday **will be included** when calculating eligibility for overtime pay and determining the overtime amount due.

## Paid Time Off Entitlement

### Vacation Leave

*   **Permanent Full-Time Employees:** Entitled to paid vacation leave after completing **one (1) year of continuous service**. The accrual rate and total days will be determined by the employee's tenure and job level, as outlined in the Vacation Leave Accrual Schedule.
*   **Permanent Part-Time Employees:** Entitled to prorated vacation leave based on their regular working hours.
*   **Contract Employees:** Not eligible for paid vacation leave under this policy.

### Sick Leave

*   Employees are entitled to paid sick leave for personal illness or injury, or to care for immediate family members. The accrual rate and maximum days are detailed in the Sick Leave Accrual Schedule. Medical certification may be required for absences exceeding a specified duration.

### Holiday Pay

*   **Exempt Employees:** Will receive their regular salary without deduction for all recognized company holidays, regardless of whether they work on the holiday.
*   **Permanent Non-Exempt Employees:** Will receive their regular holiday pay for recognized company holidays after completing **three (3) months of continuous full-time employment**.
*   **Temporary and Contract Employees:** Are not eligible for paid holiday leave.

### Time Off During Leave of Absence

Employees on an approved leave of absence (e.g., medical leave, maternity leave) will receive holiday pay if they are in a paid status during the holiday period. Employees on an unpaid leave of absence are not eligible for holiday pay.

### Religious Observances

Acme Corp respects employees' diverse religious beliefs. Employees may request unpaid time off to observe religious holidays not listed as company holidays. Such requests will be considered on a case-by-case basis, provided they do not impose an undue hardship on the company's operations. Employees may also opt to use their Personal Leave Days or Vacation Leave for religious observances. All requests for time off related to religious observances should be discussed with the HR department.
