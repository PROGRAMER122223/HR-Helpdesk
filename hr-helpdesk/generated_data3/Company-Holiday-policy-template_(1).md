# Acme Corp - Paid Time Off Policy

## Policy Statement and Objective

This Paid Time Off (PTO) policy establishes Acme Corp's approach to employee time off, encompassing holidays, personal leave, and vacation. The objective is to provide a clear framework for employees regarding time off entitlements, accrual, and usage, promoting work-life balance and operational continuity.

## Applicability

This policy applies to all full-time and part-time employees of Acme Corp. Employees covered by a separate collective bargaining agreement will adhere to the terms outlined in that agreement.

## Policy Components

### Observed Holidays

Acme Corp observes the following national holidays:

*   **Republic Day** (January 26)
*   **Holi** (Date varies)
*   **Good Friday** (Date varies)
*   **Id-ul-Fitr** (Date varies)
*   **Independence Day** (August 15)
*   **Ganesh Chaturthi** (Date varies)
*   **Dussehra** (Date varies)
*   **Diwali** (Date varies)
*   **Christmas Day** (December 25)

In addition to these, Acme Corp may observe regional holidays specific to the employee's location, as communicated by the Human Resources department.

If a designated holiday falls on a weekend, the preceding Friday or following Monday will be observed as the holiday, as determined by Acme Corp and communicated to employees.

### Paid Time Off (PTO) Accrual

All eligible employees will accrue PTO based on their employment status and tenure. PTO accrual rates are detailed in the Employee Handbook. PTO is intended to cover vacation, personal needs, and minor illnesses.

### Vacation Leave

Employees are entitled to vacation leave as per their accrued PTO. Vacation requests should be submitted to the employee's direct manager with at least two weeks' advance notice, subject to operational requirements. Approval of vacation requests is at the discretion of management.

### Personal Leave

Employees may utilize their accrued PTO for personal reasons. For extended personal leave beyond accrued PTO, employees must formally request unpaid leave through the Human Resources department, which will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis.

### Sick Leave

Minor illnesses can be covered by PTO. For extended illnesses, employees are required to notify their manager and Human Resources promptly. Medical documentation may be required for absences exceeding a specified duration.

### Working on a Holiday

In instances where business needs necessitate employees working on an observed holiday:

*   Employees will be notified at least seven (7) days in advance.
*   Non-exempt employees required to work on a holiday will receive compensation at 1.5 times their regular hourly rate for hours worked on the holiday.
*   Exempt employees required to work on a holiday will be offered one (1) compensatory day off to be taken within six (6) months of the holiday.

Hours worked on a holiday will be included in the calculation of overtime pay for non-exempt employees.

### Holiday Pay Entitlement

*   **Full-time Employees:** Entitled to their regular salary for observed holidays, regardless of whether they work.
*   **Part-time Employees:** Will receive holiday pay proportional to the number of hours they are regularly scheduled to work on that day.
*   **Temporary Employees:** Are not eligible for paid holidays.

### Leave During Holidays

Employees on approved paid leave (e.g., vacation, sick leave using PTO) during an observed holiday will receive their standard pay. Employees on unpaid leave during a holiday will not receive holiday pay.

### Religious Observances

Acme Corp respects employees' diverse religious beliefs. Employees may request unpaid time off to observe religious holidays not listed as company-observed holidays. Such requests will be considered based on operational feasibility and will not cause undue hardship to the company. Employees may also opt to use their accrued PTO for religious observances. All such requests must be submitted to Human Resources for review and approval.
