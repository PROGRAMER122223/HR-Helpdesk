# Acme Corp - Personal Device Usage Policy

## Policy Overview and Objective

Acme Corp recognizes the increasing prevalence of personal devices in the workplace and aims to provide clear guidelines for their use. This policy outlines the acceptable use, security requirements, and support provisions for employees utilizing their personal devices for work-related activities. The objective is to ensure productivity, maintain data security, and clarify responsibilities for both the employee and Acme Corp.

## Applicability

This policy applies to all full-time and part-time employees, contractors, consultants, and temporary staff of Acme Corp who use their personal network-enabled devices (such as smartphones, tablets, and laptops) to access Acme Corp’s network, systems, or data. This includes access from both company premises and remote locations.

## Permitted Use

Employees may use their personal devices for work-related purposes, provided such use adheres to the following guidelines:

*   **Business Use:** Activities that directly support Acme Corp’s business objectives and operations are considered acceptable business use.
*   **Limited Personal Use:** Incidental and reasonable personal use, such as brief personal communications or accessing non-work-related applications during designated break times, is permitted, provided it does not interfere with work duties or violate any other company policies.
*   **Prohibited Activities:** Employees are strictly prohibited from using personal devices to:
    *   Access, store, or transmit any illegal content or materials.
    *   Engage in activities that infringe on the intellectual property rights of others.
    *   Harass, discriminate, or defame any individual or group.
    *   Conduct personal business or engage in any form of unauthorized commercial activity.
    *   Access or distribute confidential or proprietary information of Acme Corp or any third party without authorization.
    *   Visit websites or download applications that are known to host malware, phishing scams, or other security threats.
    *   Engage in any activity that violates Acme Corp’s Code of Conduct or other established policies.
*   **Approved Applications:** Employees may install and use applications that are necessary for their job functions and have been approved by the IT department. A list of approved applications will be maintained by IT and made available to employees.
*   **Disapproved Applications:** Applications that are not available through official app stores (e.g., Google Play Store, Apple App Store), or those that pose a security risk, are not permitted. The IT department reserves the right to prohibit the use of any application deemed inappropriate or risky.
*   **Access to Company Resources:** Employees may be granted access to specific company resources via their personal devices, such as email, calendar, and approved collaboration tools. Access levels will be determined by the IT department based on job role and security requirements.
*   **Mobile Device Use While Driving:** Texting or emailing while driving is strictly prohibited. Hands-free communication is permitted only when legally permissible and safe to do so.

## Device Management and Support

*   **Supported Devices:** Acme Corp supports the use of personal smartphones (iOS and Android operating systems) and tablets. Specific model or version requirements may be communicated by the IT department.
*   **IT Support:** The IT department will provide support for connectivity issues related to accessing Acme Corp’s network and systems. Employees are responsible for all hardware, operating system, and carrier-related issues for their personal devices. Employees must contact the device manufacturer or their service provider for such issues.
*   **Device Configuration:** Before a personal device can access Acme Corp’s network or data, it must be registered with and configured by the IT department. This may include the installation of specific security software and approved applications.

## Financial Considerations

*   **Reimbursement:** Acme Corp will not reimburse employees for the purchase or maintenance costs of personal devices. Employees are solely responsible for all costs associated with their personal devices, including hardware, software, data plans, and associated charges (e.g., roaming, overages).

## Security Requirements

*   **Device Security:** All personal devices used for work purposes must be secured with a strong password, PIN, or biometric authentication.
    *   Passwords must meet Acme Corp’s minimum complexity requirements (e.g., length, character types).
    *   Devices must be configured to automatically lock after a period of inactivity (e.g., 5 minutes).
    *   Multiple failed login attempts will result in the device locking, requiring IT intervention for access restoration.
*   **Operating System Integrity:** Devices that have been "rooted" (Android) or "jailbroken" (iOS) are strictly prohibited from accessing Acme Corp’s network or data due to significant security risks.
*   **Application Security:** Employees are prohibited from downloading or installing any application that has not been explicitly approved by the IT department.
*   **Network Access:** Personal devices not meeting Acme Corp’s security standards or not approved by the IT department will not be granted access to the company network.
*   **Data Access Control:** Access to Acme Corp data on personal devices will be managed and restricted based on the employee's role and the principle of least privilege, as determined by the IT department.
*   **Remote Wipe Capability:** Acme Corp reserves the right to remotely wipe all company data from a personal device under the following circumstances:
    *   The device is lost or stolen.
    *   The employee’s employment with Acme Corp is terminated.
    *   A security breach, virus, or other threat to company data is detected.
    *   The device is no longer compliant with this policy.

## Risks, Liabilities, and Disclaimers

*   **Employee Responsibility for Personal Data:** While Acme Corp will endeavor to protect company data during a remote wipe, employees are solely responsible for backing up their personal data (e.g., photos, personal contacts, non-work-related files). Acme Corp is not liable for the loss of personal data.
*   **Company Rights:** Acme Corp reserves the right to monitor device usage, disconnect devices, or disable services at any time without prior notice to ensure compliance with this policy and protect its network and data.
*   **Reporting Lost or Stolen Devices:** Employees must immediately report the loss or theft of any personal device used for work purposes to Acme Corp’s IT department within 24 hours. Employees are also responsible for notifying their mobile carrier.
*   **Ethical Use:** Employees are expected to use their personal devices ethically and in accordance with all Acme Corp policies, including the Code of Conduct and Acceptable Use Policy.
*   **Data Loss:** Acme Corp is not liable for any loss of company or personal data resulting from device malfunction, software errors, malware, viruses, or other hardware/software failures.
*   **Policy Non-Compliance:** Failure to comply with this policy may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment.
