# Acme Corp - Overtime Compensation Policy

## 1. Policy Statement and Purpose

Acme Corp is committed to fairly compensating all eligible employees for all hours worked. This policy outlines the guidelines and procedures for overtime compensation, ensuring compliance with Indian labor laws and promoting a healthy work-life balance. Our objectives are to:

*   Accurately and consistently compensate employees for all authorized overtime hours worked.
*   Prevent the misuse of overtime and mitigate associated risks, such as decreased productivity, employee fatigue, and potential safety concerns.
*   Ensure all overtime practices adhere to the applicable provisions of the Factories Act, 1948, and other relevant Indian labor legislation.

## 2. Scope

This policy applies to all full-time and part-time employees of Acme Corp in India, regardless of their role or department, who are classified as non-exempt under applicable labor laws.

## 3. Definitions

*   **Standard Working Hours:** The regular, scheduled hours of work for an employee, as defined in their employment agreement and in accordance with Indian labor laws. Typically, this is 48 hours per week or as otherwise stipulated by law.
*   **Overtime:** Any hours worked by a non-exempt employee beyond their Standard Working Hours, which are authorized by management and necessary for business operations.

## 4. Overtime Eligibility and Compensation

*   **Non-Exempt Employees:** Non-exempt employees who work authorized overtime hours will be compensated at a rate of twice (2x) their ordinary rate of pay for all hours worked beyond their Standard Working Hours, as mandated by the Factories Act, 1948.
*   **Authorization:** All overtime must be pre-approved by the employee's direct manager or an authorized representative. Unapproved overtime may not be compensated.
*   **Work Location:** Overtime compensation applies to all authorized work performed for Acme Corp, irrespective of the location, provided it is accepted as contributing to the company's business objectives.

## 5. Management of Overtime

Acme Corp recognizes that while overtime may be necessary to address urgent business needs, excessive overtime can negatively impact employee well-being and performance. Therefore, we will:

*   **Accurate Record-Keeping:** Maintain precise and consistent records of all overtime hours worked by non-exempt employees through our designated timekeeping system.
*   **Prioritization of Standard Hours:** Strive to ensure that employees have the necessary resources and support to complete their tasks within Standard Working Hours.
*   **Workload Management:** Managers are responsible for proactively managing workloads to minimize the need for frequent or excessive overtime.
*   **Overtime Limits:** While adhering to legal maximums, we encourage managers to limit overtime to essential tasks. Employees are advised to discuss any concerns about excessive overtime with their manager or HR.
*   **No Discrimination:** Overtime assignments and compensation will be handled without discrimination based on any protected characteristic.

## 6. Exempt Employees

Certain employee categories may be classified as exempt from overtime pay under Indian labor laws. For these employees, overtime work is generally not expected. However, if an exempt employee is required to work beyond Standard Working Hours for business exigencies, such arrangements will be at the company's discretion and may be recognized through alternative forms of compensation or time off in lieu, as determined by management. All provisions related to managing excessive working hours and preventing fatigue will apply to exempt employees as well.

## 7. Prevention of Overtime Abuse

Acme Corp is committed to preventing the abuse of the overtime system by both management and employees.

*   **Managerial Responsibility:** Managers are expected to assign overtime judiciously and avoid pressuring employees to work unnecessary hours.
*   **Employee Responsibility:** Employees are expected to perform their duties efficiently during Standard Working Hours and only work overtime when genuinely required and authorized. Employees should not intentionally extend their working hours solely for the purpose of increasing their pay, as this can compromise work quality and lead to fatigue.
*   **Timekeeping Integrity:** All employees and managers must accurately utilize the company's timekeeping system to ensure correct recording of all working hours.

## 8. Procedure for Overtime Management

To ensure compliance and efficient processing of overtime:

1.  **Overtime Request and Approval:** The employee and their manager will discuss and agree upon the necessity and duration of any required overtime. Overtime must be authorized by the manager prior to the work being performed.
2.  **Classification Awareness:** Managers will ensure they are aware of the exempt/non-exempt status of their team members and that employees understand their classification regarding overtime eligibility.
3.  **Accurate Time Recording:** Employees will accurately record all overtime hours worked using the designated company timekeeping system. Managers will review and approve these records.
4.  **Payroll Processing:** The Payroll department will calculate overtime pay based on the approved records and in accordance with the legally mandated rate.
5.  **Payment:** Approved overtime compensation will be included in the employee's next scheduled salary payment.

## 9. Policy Review and Questions

This policy will be reviewed periodically to ensure its continued relevance and compliance with labor laws. Employees are encouraged to familiarize themselves with this policy. Any questions or concerns regarding overtime should be directed to the Human Resources department.
