## Health Monitoring and Reporting

### Symptom Reporting

Employees experiencing any symptoms associated with infectious diseases (e.g., fever, cough, shortness of breath, fatigue, loss of taste or smell) must immediately notify their direct manager and the HR department via [HR email address]. Employees should refrain from coming to the office if they are unwell and should follow the return-to-work guidelines outlined below.

## Return-to-Work Guidelines

Employees who have been diagnosed with an infectious disease or have been in close contact with a confirmed case must adhere to the following return-to-work protocols:

*   **Medical Clearance:** Provide a doctor's note confirming fitness to return to work, or a negative diagnostic test result (e.g., RT-PCR or rapid antigen test) obtained at least [Number] days after the last exposure or symptom onset.
*   **Self-Isolation Period:** Complete a minimum of [Number] days of self-isolation from the date of symptom onset or positive test result, provided they remain asymptomatic.

## Workplace Safety Measures

### Hygiene Practices

All employees are expected to practice good hygiene, including frequent handwashing with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, or using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer. Employees should cover their mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing, preferably into their elbow or a tissue, which should be disposed of immediately.

Specific requirements for PPE may be implemented based on departmental needs or specific workplace conditions.

### Environmental Cleaning

Acme Corp will maintain regular cleaning and disinfection schedules for all common areas, workstations, and high-touch surfaces within the office premises.

## Employee Support and Resources

Acme Corp is committed to supporting its employees during challenging health periods. Employees facing difficulties related to health concerns, testing, or isolation should reach out to the HR department for guidance and available support. Information on local health resources and testing facilities will be made available through internal communication channels.

## Policy Review and Updates

This policy will be reviewed periodically and may be updated to reflect changes in public health recommendations, government regulations, and the evolving needs of Acme Corp. Employees will be notified of any significant revisions.
