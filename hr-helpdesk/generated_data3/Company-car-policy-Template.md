# Acme Corp Vehicle Use Policy

## Policy Overview and Objective

This policy outlines the guidelines and expectations for the use of vehicles owned or leased by Acme Corp. These vehicles are provided to support business operations and are considered company assets. The objective is to ensure the safe, responsible, and efficient utilization of these vehicles, protecting both company assets and employee well-being.

## Applicability

This policy applies to all Acme Corp employees who are authorized to operate a company vehicle for business purposes, or who are assigned a company vehicle for regular use as part of their employment.

## Policy Provisions

### Eligibility for Company Vehicle Assignment

Acme Corp may assign vehicles to employees based on the following criteria:

*   **Business Travel Requirements:** Employees whose roles necessitate frequent travel for client meetings, site visits, or other business-related activities exceeding a predetermined annual mileage threshold (e.g., 15,000 kilometers).
*   **Operational Necessity:** Employees whose job functions inherently require the use of a vehicle for the performance of their duties (e.g., field service technicians, sales representatives with extensive territory coverage).
*   **Employee Benefit:** In select cases, a company vehicle may be provided as a perquisite of a specific role, as determined by senior management.

The decision to assign a company vehicle rests with Acme Corp management, typically in consultation with the Human Resources department. Employees who believe they require a company vehicle for their role but have not been assigned one should discuss their needs with their direct supervisor.

Employees assigned a company vehicle may use it for personal travel outside of business hours, provided all terms of this policy are adhered to. Acme Corp reserves the right to modify or withdraw vehicle assignments at its discretion.

### Prerequisites for Operating a Company Vehicle

To be authorized to drive a company vehicle, employees must meet the following conditions:

*   Possess a valid and current driving license issued by the relevant Indian transport authority.
*   Maintain a clean driving record for a minimum of three (3) years preceding the assignment. This includes no major traffic violations, accidents where the employee was deemed at fault, or convictions for driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs.
*   Successfully complete a vehicle authorization form and provide a copy of their driving license to the Human Resources department.
*   Undergo a background check that includes a review of their driving history.

### Considerations for Employees with Disabilities

Acme Corp is committed to providing reasonable accommodations for employees with disabilities to facilitate their use of company vehicles. Employees requiring specific vehicle modifications or parking arrangements should contact the Human Resources department to discuss their needs. Employees whose medical conditions or prescribed medications may impair their driving ability (e.g., affecting reaction time, vision, or cognitive function) may be restricted from operating a company vehicle.

### Driver Responsibilities

Employees operating company vehicles are expected to uphold the following responsibilities:

*   **Safe Operation:** Drive prudently, adhere to all traffic laws and regulations of India, and exercise courtesy towards other road users.
*   **Sobriety:** Never operate a company vehicle while under the influence of alcohol, illegal drugs, or any substance that impairs driving ability.
*   **Vehicle Condition:** Ensure the vehicle is maintained in a clean and safe operating condition. This includes regularly checking fuel levels, tire pressure, and essential fluid levels.
*   **Reporting:** Promptly report any mechanical issues, damage, or required maintenance to the designated Fleet Management contact or the Human Resources department.
*   **Documentation:** Accurately record all fuel expenses, tolls, and other authorized vehicle-related expenditures as per the company's expense reporting guidelines.
*   **License Status:** Immediately notify the Human Resources department if their driving license is suspended, revoked, or faces any restrictions. Failure to do so may result in disciplinary action, including the revocation of company vehicle privileges.
*   **Fatigue and Illness:** Avoid driving if feeling excessively fatigued or unwell to the extent that driving ability is compromised. During business travel, take necessary breaks or seek alternative arrangements if fatigue becomes a concern.

**Prohibited Actions:**

*   Smoking within a company vehicle.
*   Using the company vehicle for unauthorized personal business, including any form of leasing, selling, or lending.
*   Engaging in distracted driving, such as using a mobile phone for calls or text messages while operating the vehicle, unless using a hands-free device as permitted by law.
*   Allowing unauthorized individuals to drive the company vehicle, except in documented emergency situations.
*   Leaving the vehicle unlocked or in an unsecured location.
*   Using the company vehicle for any illegal activity.

### Accident Procedures

In the event of an accident involving a company vehicle:

*   Ensure the safety of all individuals involved.
*   Contact the local police authorities immediately, especially if the accident involves injuries or significant property damage.
*   Exchange necessary information with other parties involved as required by law.
*   Notify the Acme Corp Human Resources department as soon as possible to initiate insurance claims and internal reporting procedures.
*   Do not admit fault or liability at the scene of the accident without prior authorization from Acme Corp and its insurance provider.

### Acme Corp's Responsibilities

Acme Corp will endeavor to:

*   Provide vehicles that are in good working order and meet safety standards.
*   Arrange for regular scheduled maintenance and necessary repairs to ensure vehicle reliability.
*   Maintain appropriate insurance coverage for all company vehicles.
*   Provide employees with a copy of this policy and any relevant updates.
*   Maintain records of the company vehicle fleet, including maintenance history and mileage. Vehicles nearing the end of their service life or exceeding mileage thresholds may be retired from service.

*   Fines incurred due to traffic violations (e.g., speeding, parking violations) committed by the employee.
*   Costs associated with bailing out an employee arrested while operating a company vehicle.
*   Personal belongings left in a company vehicle.

### Environmental Responsibility and Cost Efficiency

Acme Corp encourages the responsible use of company vehicles to minimize environmental impact and operational costs. Employees are expected to consider alternatives to driving when feasible, such as:

*   Utilizing public transportation when it is a practical and efficient option.
*   Choosing alternative travel methods (e.g., train, air travel) for long-distance business trips where appropriate.
*   Consolidating trips or utilizing technology (e.g., video conferencing) to reduce the need for travel.

Acme Corp will strive to procure fuel-efficient and environmentally friendly vehicles where operationally viable.

*   Verbal or written warnings.
*   Suspension or revocation of company vehicle privileges.
*   Requirement for the employee to reimburse the company for damages or fines caused by their negligence or misconduct.
*   Termination of employment and/or legal action for serious offenses, such as unauthorized use for personal financial gain, driving under the influence, or causing a major accident due to gross negligence.
