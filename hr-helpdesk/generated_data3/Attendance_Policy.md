# Leave and Attendance Policy

## 1. Introduction

Acme Corp values the dedication and commitment of its employees. Punctual and consistent attendance is crucial for maintaining operational efficiency and ensuring seamless collaboration within our Information Technology environment. All employees are expected to report for duty on time, be ready to commence work at their scheduled start time, and remain engaged throughout their entire work period. Unscheduled absences, late arrivals, and early departures can disrupt team workflows and project timelines, and therefore, should be avoided.

This policy outlines the expectations and procedures regarding employee attendance. It is important to note that this policy does not supersede specific provisions for leaves covered under statutory regulations (e.g., Maternity Benefit Act, Employees' State Insurance Act) or those granted as reasonable accommodations under applicable disability laws. Such leaves will be managed according to their respective governing frameworks.

## 2. Purpose

The primary objective of this policy is to establish clear guidelines and consistent practices for managing employee attendance and absence at Acme Corp. By adhering to these procedures, we aim to enhance overall productivity, minimize disruptions caused by unscheduled absences, and ensure fairness and transparency in attendance management.

## 3. Attendance Tracking and Infractions

Acme Corp utilizes a system to track attendance and manage potential infractions. The following points system will be applied:

*   **Absence without prior notification:** 3 Points
*   **Absence with prior notification:** 1 Point
*   **Late arrival (beyond grace period):** 1 Point
*   **Early departure (before scheduled end time):** 1 Point
*   **Returning late from lunch/breaks (exceeding 15 minutes):** 1 Point

A grace period of 10 minutes is provided at the commencement of the workday. Employees are required to report any absence or anticipated lateness to their immediate supervisor or the HR department via the designated communication channel (e.g., email, internal portal) at least two hours prior to their scheduled start time. Failure to provide timely notification will result in the absence being classified as "Absence without prior notification."

Attendance infractions will be reviewed on a rolling 12-month basis. Points accumulated will be cleared at the end of this period, provided the employee has not exceeded the disciplinary thresholds outlined in this policy.

## 4. Disciplinary Actions for Attendance Infractions

Consistent adherence to attendance expectations is mandatory. Repeated attendance infractions will lead to progressive disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment. The following disciplinary steps will be taken based on accumulated points within the 12-month review period:

*   **Accumulation of 3-4 points:** Verbal Counseling and documented discussion with the supervisor.
*   **Accumulation of 5-6 points:** Formal Written Warning, with a copy placed in the employee's personnel file.
*   **Accumulation of 7-8 points:** Final Written Warning and a mandatory meeting with HR and the employee's supervisor, potentially including a period of suspension without pay.
*   **Accumulation of 9 or more points:** Termination of employment.

In cases of prolonged absence (three or more consecutive working days), employees may be required to submit a medical certificate or other appropriate documentation to validate the reason for absence.

A "Job Abandonment" will be considered if an employee is absent without notification for three consecutive working days. In such instances, employment will be terminated without prior warning.

Employees facing exceptional circumstances that may lead to unavoidable absences should proactively discuss these with their manager and the HR department. Such requests will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.

## 5. Leave Without Pay (LWP) and Unexcused Absences

While Acme Corp encourages employees to utilize their entitled leave benefits, certain situations may necessitate Leave Without Pay (LWP). These can include, but are not limited to, extended personal emergencies, unforeseen critical events, or when statutory leave entitlements have been exhausted. Employees requiring LWP must submit a formal request to their manager and HR, providing necessary justification and supporting documentation where applicable. Unapproved absences will be considered unexcused and will be subject to the disciplinary actions outlined in Section 4.

## 6. Inability to Record Attendance

All employees are required to accurately record their attendance at the beginning and end of each workday, as well as upon returning from breaks and lunch, using the designated timekeeping system. In the event of any technical issues or inability to record attendance, employees must immediately notify their supervisor or the HR department to ensure manual correction. Failure to comply with attendance recording procedures may result in disciplinary action.

## 7. Exceptions to the Attendance Policy

Certain types of absences are recognized and may be exempt from the disciplinary actions outlined in this policy, provided proper notification and documentation are submitted within a reasonable timeframe (typically within 48 hours of returning to work). These include:

*   **Statutory Leaves:** Maternity leave, paternity leave, and other leaves mandated by Indian labor laws.
*   **Approved Leave of Absence:** Pre-approved vacation, sick leave, or personal leave.
*   **Bereavement Leave:** For the death of an immediate family member, as per company policy.
*   **Jury Duty:** As required by law.
*   **Military Duty:** As required by law.

Employees are responsible for providing the necessary supporting documents (e.g., medical certificates, court summons, death certificates) to the HR department to validate these exceptions.
