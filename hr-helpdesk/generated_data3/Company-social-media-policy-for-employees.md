*   Microblogging services
*   Online forums and discussion groups

### 3.1. Personal Social Media Use During Work Hours

Acme Corp permits employees to access personal social media accounts during designated break times. However, employees are expected to:

*   **Maintain Productivity:** Personal social media use should not interfere with job responsibilities, productivity, or the productivity of colleagues. Excessive use during work hours is prohibited.
*   **Respect Confidentiality:** Employees must not disclose any confidential, proprietary, or sensitive information belonging to Acme Corp, its clients, partners, or vendors on their personal social media accounts. This includes, but is not limited to, financial data, trade secrets, product roadmaps, internal communications, and client lists.
*   **Adhere to Company Policies:** All personal social media activity must comply with Acme Corp's existing policies, including those related to harassment, discrimination, and ethical conduct. Content that is defamatory, discriminatory, harassing, or offensive is strictly prohibited.
*   **Clarify Personal Opinions:** When posting on personal social media, employees should make it clear that their views are their own and do not represent the official stance or opinions of Acme Corp. Using a disclaimer such as "Opinions are my own" is strongly recommended.
*   **Protect Intellectual Property:** Employees must not share or use Acme Corp's trademarks, logos, copyrighted materials, or other intellectual property on personal accounts without explicit written permission from the relevant department (e.g., Marketing, Legal).

Employees who are authorized to manage or contribute to official Acme Corp social media accounts, or who speak on behalf of the company in any digital capacity, must adhere to the following:

*   **Professionalism and Respect:** All communications must be professional, courteous, and respectful. Engage constructively with users, and maintain a positive and helpful tone.
*   **Accuracy and Transparency:** Ensure all information shared is accurate and up-to-date. If a mistake is made, correct it promptly and transparently.
*   **Scope of Expertise:** Employees should only comment on matters within their area of expertise and responsibility at Acme Corp. Avoid speculating or making statements on topics outside their purview.
*   **Confidentiality and Compliance:** Strictly adhere to all confidentiality, data protection, copyright, and intellectual property laws and policies.
*   **Engagement with Criticism:** Respond to comments and criticism constructively. Do not delete or ignore feedback without valid reason. Escalate significant issues or complaints to the appropriate internal department.
*   **Prohibited Content:** Never post content that is discriminatory, offensive, libelous, or that violates any company policy or applicable law.
*   **Authorization for Major Content:** Any content with potentially significant impact on Acme Corp's reputation or business must be reviewed and approved by the designated department (e.g., Marketing, Communications, Legal) before publication.

## 4. Monitoring and Enforcement

Acme Corp reserves the right to monitor social media activity conducted on company networks and devices, as well as official company social media accounts. Employees should have no expectation of privacy when using company resources for social media.

Violations of this policy will be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment. Examples of policy violations include, but are not limited to:

*   Disclosing confidential or proprietary information.
