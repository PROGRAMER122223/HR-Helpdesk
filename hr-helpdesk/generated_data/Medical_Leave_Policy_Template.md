As part of its operations, Acme Corp collects and processes information. This information includes any offline or online data that makes a person identifiable, such as names, addresses, usernames and passwords, digital footprints, photographs, identification numbers, financial data, and other sensitive personal data as defined by Data Protection Laws.

Acme Corp collects this information transparently and only with the full cooperation and knowledge of the data subjects. Once this information is available to Acme Corp, the following rules apply:
