This Remote Work Policy outlines the guidelines and procedures for employees who are approved to work remotely, either on a full-time or hybrid basis. The policy aims to ensure that remote work arrangements are managed effectively, maintaining productivity, collaboration, security, and compliance with all applicable laws and regulations in India.

### 2. Scope

This policy applies to all full-time and part-time employees of Acme Corp, regardless of their role or department, who are approved to work remotely. This policy does not apply to independent contractors or temporary staff unless explicitly stated in their contractual agreement.

### 3. Policy Statement

Acme Corp recognizes that remote work can offer significant benefits to both employees and the organization. Approved remote work arrangements will be established based on the nature of the role, the employee's performance, and the operational needs of the company. All remote work arrangements must be formally approved and adhere to the guidelines set forth in this policy.

### 4. Eligibility for Remote Work

Eligibility for remote work will be determined based on the following criteria:

*   **Role Suitability:** The nature of the employee's role must be conducive to remote work, meaning that the essential job functions can be performed effectively outside of the company's physical office premises. Roles requiring significant on-site presence, direct client interaction, or access to specialized on-site equipment may not be suitable for remote work.
*   **Employee Performance:** Employees must have a demonstrated record of satisfactory performance, reliability, and the ability to work independently and productively. Employees on a performance improvement plan may not be eligible for remote work.
*   **Technology and Infrastructure:** Employees must have access to a reliable internet connection and a suitable, secure, and distraction-free workspace at their remote location.

### 5. Types of Remote Work Arrangements

Acme Corp supports the following remote work arrangements:

*   **Full-Time Remote:** Employees who work exclusively from a remote location.
*   **Hybrid Remote:** Employees who split their work time between a remote location and the company's office. The specific schedule (e.g., number of days in office vs. remote) will be agreed upon by the employee and their manager.

### 6. Approval Process

1.  **Employee Request:** Employees interested in a remote work arrangement must submit a formal written request to their direct manager, outlining the proposed arrangement (full-time remote or hybrid schedule) and the reasons for the request.
2.  **Manager Review:** The manager will review the request based on the eligibility criteria outlined in Section 4 and the operational needs of the team and department.
3.  **Department Head/Senior Management Approval:** If the manager supports the request, it will be forwarded to the relevant Department Head or Senior Management for final approval.
4.  **HR Notification:** Upon approval, the manager will inform the Human Resources (HR) department to ensure proper documentation and record-keeping.
