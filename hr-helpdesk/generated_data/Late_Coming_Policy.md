### **Company Email Usage Policy**

**Policy Brief and Purpose**

The Acme Corp email policy is designed to guide employees on the appropriate use of their corporate email addresses. Recognizing the critical role of email in daily operations, this policy aims to safeguard confidential company data, protect our reputation, and ensure the security of our technological assets.

**Scope**

This email usage policy applies to all employees, contractors, and third parties who are assigned or granted access to Acme Corp's email systems. This includes individually assigned email addresses and departmental accounts.

**Policy Components**

Acme Corp email accounts are provided as a vital tool for business communication. While primarily intended for company-related purposes, limited personal use is permitted under specific conditions. This policy defines both proper and improper usage.

**Correct Use of Corporate Email**

Employees are permitted to use their Acme Corp email for work-related activities without significant limitations. This includes, but is not limited to:

*   Communicating with current and prospective clients, partners, and vendors.
*   Accessing necessary software and services for job functions.
*   Sharing contact information at professional events for business purposes.
*   Subscribing to industry-relevant newsletters, online services, or platforms that support professional development.

**Inappropriate Use of Corporate Email**

As representatives of Acme Corp, employees must refrain from using their corporate email for the following:

*   Sending insulting, discriminatory, or offensive content.
*   Registering for competitive services without explicit authorization.
*   Intentionally sending unsolicited bulk emails (spam), especially to colleagues.
*   Signing up for unreliable, illegal, suspect, or disreputable websites or services.
*   Distributing unlawful marketing information or solicitations.

Acme Corp reserves the right to monitor corporate email usage.

**Personal Use**

Limited personal use of corporate email is allowed, provided it does not interfere with job duties or violate any company policies. Permitted personal use includes:

*   Registering for professional development classes or meetups.
*   Sending non-confidential emails to friends and family, provided they do not constitute spam.
*   Downloading safe and appropriate content for personal use.

**Email Security**

Email is a common vector for malware, data breaches, and cyberattacks. Employees must adhere to the following security measures:

*   **Password Strength:** Set strong passwords with a minimum of eight characters, including a combination of lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and symbols. Avoid using personal information (e.g., birthdays).
*   **Password Management:** Change email passwords every four to five months. Do not write down passwords in easily accessible locations.
*   **Phishing and Malware Awareness:** Be vigilant against emails containing malware or employing phishing techniques.
    *   Do not open attachments or click on links from unknown or suspicious senders, or when the content is inadequately explained.
    *   Be cautious of clickbait titles or urgent requests.
    *   Verify sender identities and email addresses to ensure legitimacy.
    *   Look for stylistic red flags such as grammar mistakes, excessive punctuation, or inconsistent formatting.
*   **Reporting Suspicious Emails:** If an employee is uncertain about the safety of an email, they should contact the Acme Corp IT Security department immediately.
*   **Anti-Malware Updates:** Ensure anti-malware programs are kept up-to-date.

**Email Signature**

Acme Corp encourages employees to create professional email signatures that represent the company effectively. Signatures should include:

*   Employee Name
*   Employee Title
*   Company Name (with a link to the company website)
*   Phone Number
*   Company Address

Images, company logos, and work-related videos or links may be included, subject to IT department approval. Employees can seek assistance from their direct supervisor or the IT department for signature setup.

*   Unauthorized transmission of confidential company information.
*   Sending inappropriate or offensive emails to colleagues, clients, or partners.
