**Policy Number:** HR-REM-001
**Effective Date:** October 26, 2023
**Version:** 1.0

---

### 1. Purpose

Acme Corp is committed to fostering a flexible and productive work environment that supports employee well-being and operational efficiency. This Remote Work Policy outlines the guidelines and procedures for employees who are approved to work from a location other than a designated Acme Corp office. The policy aims to ensure continued productivity, maintain data security, and uphold company standards while offering flexibility to eligible employees.

### 2. Scope

This policy applies to all full-time and part-time employees of Acme Corp who are approved for remote work arrangements. This policy does not apply to employees who are required to be on-site for the nature of their role or to employees covered by specific project-based agreements that dictate work location.

### 3. Eligibility for Remote Work

Eligibility for remote work will be determined based on several factors, including but not limited to:

*   **Job Role Suitability:** The nature of the employee's role and responsibilities must be conducive to remote work without negatively impacting productivity, collaboration, or service delivery. Roles requiring significant on-site presence, direct client interaction, or access to specialized on-site equipment may not be eligible.
*   **Performance:** Employees must have a consistent record of satisfactory performance and demonstrate the ability to work independently and manage their time effectively.
*   **Technology and Infrastructure:** Employees must have a reliable internet connection and a suitable, distraction-free workspace at their remote location that meets Acme Corp's security and operational requirements.
*   **Managerial Approval:** All remote work arrangements require the explicit approval of the employee's direct manager and department head.

### 4. Types of Remote Work Arrangements

Acme Corp recognizes various remote work models:

*   **Fully Remote:** Employees who work exclusively from a location outside of an Acme Corp office.
*   **Hybrid:** Employees who split their work time between an Acme Corp office and an approved remote location. Specific schedules will be agreed upon with their manager.

### 5. Application and Approval Process

1.  **Request Submission:** Employees interested in a remote work arrangement must submit a formal written request to their direct manager. The request should detail the proposed remote work location, the desired arrangement (fully remote or hybrid), and how they will maintain productivity and connectivity.
2.  **Managerial Review:** Managers will review the request based on the eligibility criteria outlined in Section 3 and the operational needs of the team and department.
3.  **Department Head Approval:** If the manager supports the request, it will be forwarded to the department head for further review and approval.
4.  **HR Review and Finalization:** Approved requests will be sent to the Human Resources department for final review and documentation. HR will ensure compliance with this policy and relevant labor laws.
5.  **Remote Work Agreement:** Upon approval, the employee will be required to sign a formal Remote Work Agreement outlining the terms and conditions of their arrangement, including expectations for work hours, communication, data security, and performance.

### 6. Employee Responsibilities

Employees approved for remote work are expected to:

*   **Maintain Productivity:** Meet all performance expectations and deadlines as if working on-site.
*   **Adhere to Work Hours:** Maintain agreed-upon work hours and be available during core business hours as defined by their department.
*   **Communication:** Maintain regular and proactive communication with their manager, team members, and clients through approved company channels (e.g., email, instant messaging, video conferencing).
*   **Data Security and Confidentiality:** Strictly adhere to Acme Corp's Data Protection and Cybersecurity policies. This includes securing company data, using company-approved devices and networks, and protecting confidential information.
*   **Workspace:** Maintain a safe, ergonomic, and distraction-free workspace. Acme Corp is not responsible for injuries sustained in the remote workspace.
*   **Equipment:** Utilize company-provided equipment responsibly and ensure its security. Personal devices used for work must comply with company security standards.
*   **Reporting:** Promptly report any changes in their remote work location or circumstances that may affect their ability to work remotely.

### 7. Manager Responsibilities

Managers of remote employees are expected to:

*   **Set Clear Expectations:** Define clear performance goals, deliverables, and communication protocols for remote team members.
*   **Foster Inclusion:** Ensure remote employees are included in team activities, discussions, and opportunities, regardless of their work location.
*   **Regular Check-ins:** Conduct regular one-on-one meetings and team check-ins to monitor progress, provide feedback, and address any challenges.
*   **Performance Management:** Apply performance management standards consistently to both on-site and remote employees.
*   **Support:** Provide necessary support and resources to remote employees to ensure their success.

### 8. Technology and Equipment

*   **Company-Provided Equipment:** Acme Corp will provide necessary equipment (e.g., laptop, peripherals) as deemed appropriate for the role. Employees are responsible for the care and security of company-issued equipment.
*   **Internet Connectivity:** Employees are responsible for ensuring reliable internet connectivity at their remote work location. Reimbursement for internet expenses may be provided as per the Employee Business Expense Policy.
*   **Technical Support:** Remote employees can access IT support through standard company channels.

### 9. Data Security and Confidentiality

Remote employees must strictly adhere to Acme Corp's Data Protection Policy and Cybersecurity Policy. This includes:

*   Implementing strong password practices.
*   Protecting company devices from unauthorized access.
*   Not storing sensitive company data on personal devices or unsecured cloud storage.
*   Reporting any suspected data breaches or security incidents immediately to the IT Security department.

### 10. Compensation and Benefits

Employee compensation and benefits will not be affected by an approved remote work arrangement, unless otherwise specified in the Remote Work Agreement or required by local labor laws.

Employees working remotely may be required to travel to an Acme Corp office or other locations for meetings, training, or business needs. Such travel will be governed by the Company Travel Policy.

### 13. Policy Review and Modification
