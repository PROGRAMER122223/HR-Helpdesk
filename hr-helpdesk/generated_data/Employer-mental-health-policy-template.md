## Acme Corp - Employee Handbook Policy: Remote Work Guidelines

**1. Purpose**

Acme Corp is committed to fostering a flexible and productive work environment. This policy outlines the guidelines and expectations for employees working remotely, whether on a full-time or hybrid basis. Our aim is to support work-life balance, enhance employee well-being, and maintain operational efficiency while leveraging technology to facilitate seamless collaboration.

**2. Scope**

This policy applies to all regular full-time and part-time employees of Acme Corp who are approved to work remotely. This includes employees working under a hybrid model (a combination of remote and in-office work) and those working entirely remotely.

**3. Eligibility for Remote Work**

Eligibility for remote work will be determined based on the following criteria:

*   **Job Role Suitability:** The nature of the employee's role and responsibilities must be conducive to remote work without negatively impacting productivity, collaboration, or the ability to perform essential job functions. Roles requiring significant on-site presence, direct client interaction, or access to specialized on-site equipment may not be suitable for full-time remote work.
*   **Performance:** Employees must have a demonstrated record of consistent performance, reliability, and adherence to company policies.
*   **Infrastructure:** Employees must have a dedicated, safe, and distraction-free workspace at their remote location, equipped with a reliable internet connection capable of supporting company systems and communication tools.

**4. Types of Remote Work Arrangements**

Acme Corp recognizes the following remote work arrangements:

*   **Full-Time Remote:** Employees who work entirely from a location other than an Acme Corp office.
