## Acme Corp - Employee Handbook Policy: Remote Work Guidelines

**1. Purpose and Scope**

Acme Corp is committed to fostering a flexible and productive work environment. This policy outlines the guidelines and expectations for employees working remotely, whether on a full-time or hybrid basis. It aims to ensure continued operational efficiency, maintain data security, and support employee well-being while working outside of traditional office premises. This policy applies to all Acme Corp employees, regardless of their role or department, who are approved for remote work arrangements.

**2. Eligibility for Remote Work**

Eligibility for remote work will be assessed based on several factors, including:

*   **Job Role Suitability:** The nature of the employee's role and whether it can be effectively performed remotely without compromising productivity, collaboration, or access to necessary resources.
*   **Performance:** Employees must have a demonstrated history of meeting or exceeding performance expectations.
*   **Infrastructure:** Employees must have a reliable internet connection and a suitable, safe, and distraction-free workspace at their remote location.
*   **Managerial Approval:** All remote work arrangements require the explicit approval of the employee's direct manager and adherence to departmental needs.

**3. Types of Remote Work Arrangements**

Acme Corp recognizes the following primary remote work models:

*   **Full-Time Remote:** Employees who work exclusively from a location other than an Acme Corp office.
*   **Hybrid Remote:** Employees who split their work time between an Acme Corp office and an approved remote location. Specific schedules and days in the office will be agreed upon with their manager.

**4. Expectations for Remote Employees**

*   **Work Hours and Availability:**
    *   Remote employees are expected to maintain their standard work hours as agreed upon with their manager, unless a flexible schedule has been formally approved.

    *   Any planned deviations from standard work hours must be communicated to and approved by the manager in advance.
*   **Productivity and Performance:**
    *   Performance standards and productivity expectations remain the same for remote employees as for in-office employees.
