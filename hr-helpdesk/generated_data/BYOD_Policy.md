## Acme Corp - Employee Handbook Policy: Remote Work Guidelines

**1. Purpose**

Acme Corp is committed to fostering a flexible and productive work environment. This policy outlines the guidelines and expectations for employees working remotely, whether on a full-time or hybrid basis. Our aim is to support work-life balance, enhance employee well-being, and maintain operational efficiency while ensuring the security and integrity of our information and systems.

**2. Scope**

This policy applies to all regular full-time and part-time employees of Acme Corp who are approved to work remotely. This includes employees working under a hybrid model (partially remote, partially in-office) and those working fully remotely. Contractors and temporary staff may be subject to different terms as outlined in their respective agreements.

**3. Eligibility for Remote Work**

Eligibility for remote work will be determined based on several factors, including:

*   **Job Role Suitability:** The nature of the employee's role and whether it can be effectively performed outside of the traditional office environment without compromising productivity, collaboration, or access to necessary resources.
*   **Performance:** Employees must have a consistent record of meeting or exceeding performance expectations.
*   **Infrastructure:** Employees must have a suitable and secure remote work environment, including reliable internet connectivity and a dedicated workspace.
*   **Managerial Approval:** All remote work arrangements require the approval of the employee's direct manager and may require further approval from department heads or HR, depending on the arrangement.

**4. Types of Remote Work Arrangements**

Acme Corp recognizes the following remote work arrangements:

*   **Hybrid Work:** Employees split their work time between the office and a remote location. Specific schedules (e.g., days in office, days remote) will be agreed upon with the manager.
*   **Full-Time Remote:** Employees work exclusively from a remote location. This arrangement is typically for roles that do not require regular in-office presence.

*   **Maintain Productivity:** Perform all job duties and responsibilities to the same standard as if working in the office.
*   **Adhere to Work Hours:** Be available and responsive during agreed-upon core working hours. Timekeeping procedures must be followed diligently.

Managers of remote employees are responsible for:

*   **Performance Management:** Setting clear expectations, providing regular feedback, and evaluating performance consistently for both in-office and remote employees.

*   **Security:** Implement robust security measures to protect company data and systems.
*   **Policy Updates:** Regularly review and update this policy to reflect evolving business needs and best practices.

This monitoring will be conducted in compliance with applicable laws and regulations.
