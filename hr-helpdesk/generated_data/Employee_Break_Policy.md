### **Company Email Usage Policy**

**Policy Brief and Purpose**

The Company Email Usage Policy at Acme Corp is designed to guide employees on the appropriate and responsible use of their corporate email addresses. Recognizing that email is a critical tool for daily operations, this policy aims to ensure the security of company data, protect Acme Corp's reputation, and safeguard our technological assets.

**Scope**

This email usage policy applies to all employees, contractors, and any other individuals who are assigned or granted access to Acme Corp's email system. This includes individually assigned email addresses as well as those assigned to departments.

**Policy Components**

Acme Corp provides corporate email as a valuable communication tool to support employees in their professional responsibilities. While the primary use is for company-related purposes, limited personal use is permitted under specific conditions. This policy defines proper and improper use to maintain a secure and productive environment.

**Correct Use of Corporate Email**

Employees of Acme Corp are permitted to use their company email for all work-related purposes without limitation. This includes, but is not limited to:

*   Communicating with current and prospective clients, partners, and vendors.
*   Accessing necessary software and services for job functions.
*   Sharing contact information at professional events for business purposes.
*   Subscribing to industry-relevant newsletters, online services, or platforms that contribute to professional development.

**Inappropriate Use of Corporate Email**

As corporate email users represent Acme Corp, employees must refrain from the following actions:

*   Sending insulting, discriminatory, or offensive content.
*   Registering for competitive services without explicit authorization.
*   Intentionally sending unsolicited bulk emails (spam), especially to colleagues.
*   Signing up for unreliable, illegal, suspect, or disreputable websites or services.
*   Sending emails containing unlawful marketing information or solicitations.

Acme Corp reserves the right to monitor corporate email usage to ensure compliance with this policy and to protect company interests.

**Personal Use**

Limited personal use of corporate email is allowed, provided it does not interfere with job duties or violate any other company policies. Permitted personal use includes:

*   Registering for professional development classes or meetups.
*   Sending occasional, non-confidential emails to friends and family.
*   Downloading safe and appropriate personal content, such as guides or ebooks, provided it does not pose a security risk.

**Email Security**

Email is a common vector for malware, data breaches, and phishing attacks, which can compromise Acme Corp's reputation, security, and equipment. Employees must adhere to the following security measures:

*   **Strong Passwords:** Set strong passwords with a minimum of eight characters, including a combination of lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and symbols. Avoid using personal information (e.g., birthdays) or easily guessable patterns.
*   **Password Management:** Change email passwords every four to five months. Do not write down passwords in an insecure manner.
*   **Phishing and Malware Awareness:** Be vigilant against emails containing malware or employing phishing techniques.
    *   Do not open attachments or click on links from unknown or suspicious senders, or when the content is inadequately explained.
    *   Be cautious of clickbait titles.
    *   Verify the legitimacy of senders by checking names and email addresses.
    *   Look for stylistic red flags such as grammar mistakes, excessive use of exclamation marks, or inconsistent capitalization.

If an employee is uncertain about the safety of an email, they should contact the IT Security department immediately. Employees are also instructed to keep their anti-malware programs updated.

**Email Signature**

Acme Corp encourages employees to create professional email signatures that accurately represent the company. For employees who interact with clients or partners, particular attention should be paid to the closing of emails. A standard professional signature should include:

*   [Employee Name]
*   [Employee Title]
*   Acme Corp [Company Website Link]
*   [Phone Number]
*   [Company Address]

Images, company logos, and work-related videos or links may be included in email signatures, subject to IT department approval. Employees can seek assistance from their direct supervisor or the IT department for signature setup.

**Disciplinary Consequences**

Employees who fail to adhere to this email usage policy will be subject to disciplinary action, which may include termination of employment. Examples of violations that could lead to disciplinary action include:

*   Unauthorized transmission of confidential company information.
*   Sending inappropriate or offensive emails to colleagues, clients, or partners.
*   Using the corporate email address for any unlawful activity.
