Acme Corp is committed to fostering a flexible and productive work environment. This Remote Work Policy outlines the guidelines and procedures for employees who are approved to work from a location other than a designated Acme Corp office. The purpose of this policy is to ensure that remote work arrangements support business objectives, maintain productivity, uphold data security, and promote employee well-being, while complying with all applicable Indian labor laws and regulations.

This policy applies to all Acme Corp employees, regardless of their employment status (full-time, part-time), who are approved for a remote work arrangement. This includes employees working from home, co-working spaces, or any other location approved by Acme Corp.

3.1. **Role Suitability:** Eligibility for remote work will be assessed based on the nature of the employee's role and responsibilities.
