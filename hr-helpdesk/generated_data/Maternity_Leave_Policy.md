When using their corporate email, employees represent Acme Corp. Therefore, they must not:

*   Sending occasional emails to friends and family, provided no confidential information is disclosed and the emails do not constitute spam.
*   Downloading guides, ebooks, or other content for personal use, as long as they are safe and appropriate.

**Email Security**

Email is a common vector for malware, phishing attacks, and data breaches, which can compromise Acme Corp's reputation, security, and operational integrity. Employees must adhere to the following security measures:

*   **Strong Passwords:** Set strong, unique passwords for email accounts with a minimum of eight characters, including a combination of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols. Avoid using personal information (e.g., birthdays, names) or easily guessable patterns.
*   **Password Management:** Change email passwords every four to six months. Do not write down passwords in easily accessible locations. Consider using a company-approved password manager.
*   **Phishing and Malware Awareness:** Be vigilant about emails containing suspicious attachments or links. Employees are instructed to:
    *   Not open attachments or click on links from unknown or untrusted senders, or when the content is inadequately explained.
    *   Be cautious of clickbait titles or urgent requests that seem unusual.
    *   Verify the sender's identity and email address to ensure legitimacy.
    *   Look for stylistic red flags such as grammar mistakes, excessive use of exclamation marks, or inconsistent formatting.
*   **Reporting Suspicious Emails:** If an employee is uncertain about the safety of a received email, they should contact the IT Security department immediately for guidance.
*   **Anti-Malware Software:** Ensure that anti-malware and antivirus programs on company devices are kept updated.

**Email Signature**

Acme Corp encourages employees to use professional email signatures that accurately represent the company and their role.

Company logos, work-related images, and approved links may be included, subject to IT guidelines. Employees unsure about creating or updating their signatures should consult their direct supervisor or the IT department.
