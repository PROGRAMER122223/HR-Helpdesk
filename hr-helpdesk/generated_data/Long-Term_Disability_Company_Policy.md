**4. Reporting Procedures**

Acme Corp encourages prompt reporting of any potentially harmful conditions, threats, or incidents of workplace violence.

*   **Immediate Reporting:** Any employee who witnesses or experiences an incident of workplace violence, or perceives a potentially dangerous situation, must report it immediately to their supervisor or the Human Resources (HR) department.
*   **Anonymous Reporting:** Anonymous reports are welcome and will be investigated. However, providing contact information can assist in a more thorough investigation.
*   **Confidentiality:** All reports will be handled with the utmost confidentiality, and information will only be shared with those who have a legitimate need to know for investigation and resolution purposes.
*   **Investigation:** All reported incidents will be investigated promptly, fairly, and thoroughly. The outcomes of investigations will be communicated to the involved parties to the extent possible and appropriate.
*   **Action:** Acme Corp will take appropriate action based on the findings of any investigation, which may include disciplinary measures, security enhancements, or other preventative actions.

**5. Measures to Reduce Risk**

Acme Corp implements the following measures to reduce the risk of workplace violence:

*   **Hiring Practices:** The HR department conducts appropriate background investigations on candidates for positions where such checks are legally permissible and relevant, to assess their backgrounds and decrease the risk of hiring individuals with a history of violent behavior.
*   **Safety and Security:** Acme Corp conducts regular inspections of its facilities to identify and mitigate potential workplace violence hazards. Appropriate security measures and corrective actions will be implemented as needed.
*   **Employee Conduct Awareness:** While Acme Corp does not expect employees to be experts in identifying potentially dangerous individuals, all employees are expected to use common sense and notify HR if any employee exhibits conduct that could indicate a potentially harmful situation. Such conduct may include, but is not limited to:
    *   Talking about firearms or bringing them to work.
    *   Exhibiting overt expressions of anxiety, resentment, animosity, or rage.
    *   Using threatening language.
    *   Showing a severe or sudden drop in performance.
    *   Acting in an unreasonable or improper manner.
*   **Employee Support:** Acme Corp will identify and maintain a list of employees who may be at higher risk of becoming victims of violence due to the nature of their job or vulnerability to harassment or threats from non-employees. HR and security will work with these employees to develop plans to prepare for potential emergency scenarios.

**6. Emergency/Dangerous Situations**

In the event an employee encounters an armed or dangerous person:

*   **Do Not Confront:** Employees should not attempt to challenge or disarm the individual.
*   **Maintain Calm:** Remain as calm as possible.
*   **Communicate:** Maintain eye contact and communicate with the individual if possible and safe to do so.
