### **Company Email Usage Policy**

**Policy Brief and Purpose**

The Company Email Usage Policy at Acme Corp is designed to guide employees on the appropriate and responsible use of their corporate email addresses. Recognizing that email is a critical tool for daily operations, this policy aims to clarify usage limitations, protect confidential company data, and safeguard our organizational reputation and technological assets.

**Scope**

This email usage policy applies to all employees, contractors, and any third parties who are assigned or granted access to Acme Corp's email systems. This includes individually assigned email addresses as well as those assigned to departments.

**Policy Components**

Acme Corp provides corporate email as a vital communication tool to support employees in their professional responsibilities. While the primary use is for company-related purposes, limited personal use is permitted under specific conditions. This policy defines both proper and improper use of corporate email.

**Correct Use of Corporate Email**

Employees of Acme Corp are permitted to use their company email for work-related purposes without significant limitations. This includes, but is not limited to:

*   Communicating with current or prospective clients, partners, and vendors.
*   Accessing necessary software and online services required for job functions.
*   Sharing contact information at professional events, conferences, or career fairs for business purposes.
*   Subscribing to industry-related newsletters, online services, or platforms that contribute to professional development and job performance.

**Inappropriate Use of Corporate Email**

As corporate email users represent Acme Corp, they must refrain from the following actions:

*   Sending insulting, discriminatory, or offensive content.
*   Registering for competitive services or products without explicit authorization.
*   Intentionally sending unsolicited bulk emails (spam), especially to colleagues.
*   Signing up for unreliable, illegal, suspect, or disreputable websites or services.
*   Sending emails containing unlawful marketing information or solicitations.

Acme Corp reserves the right to monitor corporate email communications.

**Personal Use**

Employees may use their corporate email for limited personal matters, provided it does not interfere with work responsibilities or violate any company policies. Examples include:

*   Registering for professional development classes or meetups that may be beneficial.
*   Sending non-confidential emails to friends and family, ensuring no spamming occurs.
*   Downloading safe and appropriate content for personal use, such as guides or ebooks.

**Email Security**

Email systems are a common vector for malware, data breaches, and cyberattacks, which can harm Acme Corp's reputation, legal standing, and technological infrastructure. Employees must adhere to the following security measures:

*   **Password Strength:** Set strong passwords with a minimum of eight characters, including a combination of lowercase and uppercase letters, numbers, and symbols. Avoid using personal information (e.g., birthdays) or easily guessable sequences.
*   **Password Management:** Do not write down passwords. If absolutely necessary, store them securely and change them regularly.
*   **Password Changes:** Change email passwords every four to five months.
*   **Phishing and Malware Awareness:** Be vigilant about emails containing potential malware or employing phishing techniques. Employees are instructed to:
    *   Avoid opening attachments or clicking on links from unknown or suspicious senders, especially if the content is vague or unexpected.
    *   Be cautious of clickbait titles or urgent requests.
    *   Verify the sender's identity and email address to ensure legitimacy.
    *   Look for stylistic red flags such as grammar mistakes, excessive punctuation, or inconsistent formatting.

Employees facing difficulties in identifying safe emails should contact the IT Security department immediately. Employees are also instructed to keep their anti-malware programs updated.

**Email Signature**

Acme Corp encourages employees to create professional email signatures that accurately represent the company. Salespeople and executives, in particular, should pay close attention to their email closings. An example of a professional signature is:

[Employee Name]
[Employee Title], [Company Name with Link]
[Phone Number] | [Company Address]

Company logos, work-related images, and approved links may be included in email signatures. Employees unsure about formatting their signature should consult their direct supervisor or the IT department.

**Disciplinary Consequences**

Employees who fail to adhere to this email usage policy will be subject to disciplinary action, which may include termination of employment. Examples of violations leading to disciplinary action include:

*   Unauthorized transmission of confidential company information.
*   Sending inappropriate or offensive emails to colleagues, clients, or partners.
*   Using the corporate email address for any unlawful activity.
