### 1. Purpose

Acme Corp is committed to fostering a flexible and productive work environment that supports employee well-being and business continuity. This Remote Work Policy outlines the guidelines and procedures for employees who are approved to work remotely, either on a full-time or hybrid basis. The policy aims to ensure that remote work arrangements are managed effectively, maintaining productivity, collaboration, security, and compliance with all applicable laws and regulations.

### 2. Scope

This policy applies to all full-time and part-time employees of Acme Corp who are approved for remote work arrangements. This includes employees working from home, co-working spaces, or other locations outside of Acme Corp's primary office facilities. This policy does not apply to employees whose roles inherently require their physical presence at an Acme Corp facility on a full-time basis, unless a specific hybrid arrangement is approved.

### 3. Policy Guidelines

#### 3.1. Eligibility for Remote Work

Eligibility for remote work will be determined based on several factors, including but not limited to:

*   **Job Role Suitability:** The nature of the employee's role and whether it can be performed effectively outside of the office environment without compromising productivity, collaboration, or security.
*   **Performance:** Employees must have a consistent record of satisfactory performance and demonstrate the ability to work independently and manage their time effectively.
*   **Technology and Infrastructure:** Employees must have access to a reliable internet connection and a suitable, safe, and distraction-free workspace.
*   **Managerial Approval:** All remote work arrangements require the explicit approval of the employee's direct manager and may require further approval from department heads or HR, depending on the arrangement.

#### 3.2. Types of Remote Work Arrangements

Acme Corp recognizes the following types of remote work arrangements:

*   **Full Remote:** Employees who work exclusively from a location outside of Acme Corp's primary office facilities.
*   **Hybrid Remote:** Employees who split their work time between an Acme Corp office and an approved remote location. The specific schedule (e.g., number of days in office vs. remote) will be agreed upon by the employee and their manager.

#### 3.3. Remote Work Environment and Safety

*   **Workspace:** Employees are responsible for establishing and maintaining a safe, ergonomic, and productive workspace at their remote location. This includes ensuring adequate lighting, ventilation, and a secure environment.
*   **Safety:** Employees are responsible for their own safety while working remotely. Acme Corp is not liable for injuries sustained in an employee's remote workspace, unless such injury is directly related to company-provided equipment or negligence on the part of Acme Corp.
*   **Data Security:** Employees must adhere to Acme Corp's Data Protection and Cybersecurity policies at all times. This includes using secure networks, protecting company devices, and maintaining the confidentiality of company information.

#### 3.4. Work Hours and Availability

*   **Standard Work Hours:** Remote employees are expected to maintain their agreed-upon work hours and be available during core business hours as defined by their department and manager.
*   **Communication:** Remote employees must maintain regular communication with their managers and team members through approved company channels (e.g., email, instant messaging, video conferencing). Response times should be consistent with in-office expectations.
*   **Time Tracking:** All employees, regardless of work location, are required to accurately record their work hours using Acme Corp's designated timekeeping system.

#### 3.5. Equipment and Technology

*   **Company-Provided Equipment:** Acme Corp will provide necessary equipment (e.g., laptops, monitors) to employees approved for remote work, as deemed necessary for their role. Employees are responsible for the care and security of company-issued equipment.
*   **Personal Devices:** The use of personal devices for work purposes must comply with Acme Corp's Cybersecurity Policy.
*   **Internet Connectivity:** Employees are responsible for ensuring reliable internet connectivity at their remote work location. Acme Corp may provide a stipend to contribute towards internet costs, as outlined in the Compensation and Benefits section.

#### 3.6. Compensation and Benefits

*   **Salary:** An employee's salary and benefits will not be adversely affected by an approved remote work arrangement, provided the arrangement does not alter their employment status or role.
*   **Stipend:** Acme Corp may provide a monthly stipend to eligible remote employees to help cover expenses such as internet service, utilities, or home office supplies. The amount and eligibility for this stipend will be detailed in the Compensation and Benefits section of the Employee Handbook.
*   **Reimbursement:** Expenses incurred for remote work must be pre-approved and submitted in accordance with Acme Corp's Employee Business Expense Policy.

#### 3.7. Performance Management

*   **Performance Expectations:** Performance standards and expectations remain the same for remote employees as for in-office employees.
*   **Performance Reviews:** Remote employees will participate in regular performance reviews and feedback sessions with their managers.

#### 3.8. Travel

*   **Business Travel:** Remote employees may be required to travel to Acme Corp offices or other locations for meetings, training, or other business purposes. Such travel will be governed by Acme Corp's Company Travel Policy.
