### 1. Purpose

Acme Corp is committed to fostering a flexible and productive work environment that supports employee well-being and business continuity. This Remote Work Policy outlines the guidelines and procedures for employees who are approved to work remotely, either on a full-time or hybrid basis. The policy aims to ensure that remote work arrangements are managed effectively, maintaining productivity, collaboration, security, and compliance with all applicable laws and regulations.

### 2. Scope

This policy applies to all full-time and part-time employees of Acme Corp who are approved for remote work arrangements. This includes employees working from home, co-working spaces, or other locations outside of Acme Corp's primary office facilities. This policy does not apply to employees whose roles inherently require their physical presence at an Acme Corp facility on a full-time basis, unless a specific hybrid arrangement is approved.

### 3. Policy Guidelines

#### 3.1. Eligibility for Remote Work

Eligibility for remote work will be determined based on several factors, including:

*   **Job Role Suitability:** The nature of the employee's role and responsibilities must be conducive to remote work without negatively impacting productivity, collaboration, or service delivery. Roles requiring significant on-site presence, direct client interaction, or access to specialized on-site equipment may not be eligible.
*   **Performance:** Employees must have a demonstrated history of meeting or exceeding performance expectations and exhibiting a high degree of self-discipline and accountability.
*   **Technology and Infrastructure:** Employees must have access to a reliable internet connection and a suitable, secure, and distraction-free workspace at their remote location.
*   **Managerial Approval:** All remote work arrangements require the approval of the employee's direct manager and may require further approval from department heads or HR, depending on the arrangement.

#### 3.2. Types of Remote Work Arrangements

Acme Corp recognizes the following types of remote work arrangements:

*   **Full-Time Remote:** Employees who work exclusively from a location outside of an Acme Corp office.
*   **Hybrid Remote:** Employees who split their work time between an Acme Corp office and an approved remote location. Specific schedules and days in the office will be agreed upon with the manager.

#### 3.3. Application and Approval Process

1.  **Request Submission:** Employees interested in a remote work arrangement must submit a formal Remote Work Request Form to their direct manager. The form will require details about the proposed arrangement, the remote work location, and justification for the request.
2.  **Managerial Review:** Managers will review the request, considering job suitability, employee performance, team needs, and potential impact on operations.
3.  **Departmental/HR Approval:** Approved requests will be forwarded to the relevant department head and/or the HR department for final review and approval.
4.  **Formal Agreement:** Upon approval, a formal Remote Work Agreement will be established between the employee and Acme Corp, outlining the terms and conditions of the arrangement. This agreement will be reviewed and signed by both parties.

#### 3.4. Workspace and Equipment

*   **Workspace:** Employees are responsible for maintaining a safe, secure, and ergonomic workspace at their remote location. Acme Corp is not liable for injuries sustained in the employee's remote workspace.
*   **Company-Provided Equipment:** Acme Corp will provide necessary equipment (e.g., laptops, monitors) as deemed essential for the role. Employees are responsible for the care and security of company-issued equipment.
*   **Personal Equipment:** If employees use personal equipment for work, they must ensure it meets Acme Corp's security and compatibility standards.
*   **Internet Connectivity:** Employees are responsible for ensuring reliable internet connectivity at their remote work location. Acme Corp may provide a stipend to contribute towards internet costs, as outlined in the Compensation and Benefits section.

#### 3.5. Data Security and Confidentiality

*   **Compliance:** Employees working remotely must adhere to all Acme Corp data security, privacy, and confidentiality policies.
*   **Secure Networks:** Access to company networks must be through secure, company-approved methods (e.g., VPN). Public Wi-Fi networks should be avoided for accessing sensitive company data.
*   **Data Protection:** Employees must take all reasonable measures to protect company data from unauthorized access, disclosure, loss, or damage.
*   **Reporting Breaches:** Any suspected data breaches or security incidents must be reported immediately to the IT Security department.

#### 3.6. Communication and Availability

*   **Work Hours:** Remote employees are expected to maintain their agreed-upon work hours and be available during core business hours as defined by their department.
*   **Communication Channels:** Employees must remain accessible via company-approved communication tools (e.g., email, instant messaging, video conferencing) during their work hours.
*   **Status Updates:** Employees should keep their status updated on communication platforms to reflect their availability (e.g., "available," "in a meeting," "away").
*   **Team Collaboration:** Managers will establish clear communication protocols for their teams to ensure effective collaboration and information sharing.

#### 3.7. Performance Management

*   **Expectations:** Performance expectations for remote employees are the same as for in-office employees. Performance will be evaluated based on results, productivity, and adherence to job responsibilities.
*   **Regular Check-ins:** Managers will conduct regular check-ins with remote employees to discuss progress, provide feedback, and address any challenges.

#### 3.8. Compensation and Benefits

*   **Salary:** Salary and benefits will generally remain unchanged for employees approved for remote work, unless otherwise specified in the Remote Work Agreement.
*   **Internet Stipend:** Acme Corp may provide a monthly stipend to eligible remote employees to offset internet costs. The amount and eligibility criteria for this stipend will be communicated separately by HR.
*   **Equipment Reimbursement:** Expenses for approved equipment or home office supplies may be reimbursed according to Acme Corp's Employee Expense Policy.

#### 3.9. Travel

*   **Business Travel:** Remote employees may be required to travel to Acme Corp offices or other locations for meetings, training, or business purposes. Travel expenses will be reimbursed in accordance with Acme Corp's Travel Policy.
*   **Personal Travel:** Acme Corp is not responsible for travel expenses incurred for personal reasons or for commuting to an approved remote work location.

#### 3.10. Termination of Remote Work Arrangement

*   **Company Discretion:** Acme Corp reserves the right to modify, suspend, or terminate an employee's remote work arrangement at any time, with reasonable notice, based on business needs, performance issues, or policy violations.
*   **Employee Request:** Employees may request to end their remote work arrangement and return to an in-office role. Such requests will be reviewed based on available positions and business needs.

### 4. Compliance and Consequences

*   **Policy Adherence:** All employees approved for remote work must adhere to this policy and all other applicable Acme Corp policies.
*   **Violations:** Failure to comply with this Remote Work Policy may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment, and revocation of remote work privileges.
