## Acme Corp - Employee Handbook

### **Company Email Usage Policy**

**Policy Brief and Purpose**

The Acme Corp corporate email system is a vital tool for business communication. This policy outlines the acceptable and unacceptable uses of company email to ensure data security, protect company reputation, and maintain a professional communication environment. Adherence to this policy is mandatory for all employees and authorized users.

**Scope**

This policy applies to all employees, contractors, vendors, and any other individuals who are assigned or granted access to Acme Corp's email system. This includes individually assigned email addresses and departmental email accounts.

**Policy Components**

Acme Corp provides corporate email accounts to facilitate efficient business operations. While the primary use is for company-related activities, limited personal use is permitted under specific conditions. However, employees must always remember that they represent Acme Corp when using their company email, and their actions reflect on the organization.

**Correct Use of Corporate Email**

Employees are permitted to use their company email for all work-related purposes. This includes, but is not limited to:

*   Communicating with current and prospective clients, partners, and vendors.
*   Accessing necessary software and online services for business operations.
*   Sharing contact information for business purposes at conferences, corporate events, or networking opportunities.
*   Subscribing to industry-related newsletters, online services, or platforms that contribute to professional development and job performance.

**Inappropriate Use of Corporate Email**

Employees must not use their company email for any of the following activities:

*   Sending or forwarding emails containing insulting, discriminatory, defamatory, or offensive content.
*   Registering for competitive services or products without explicit authorization.
*   Intentionally sending unsolicited bulk emails (spam) to internal or external recipients.
*   Signing up for unreliable, illegal, suspect, or disreputable websites or services.
*   Sending emails containing unlawful marketing information, solicitations, or chain letters.
*   Using company email for personal gain or to conduct outside business activities.
*   Disclosing confidential or proprietary company information without proper authorization.
*   Engaging in any activity that violates Acme Corp's Code of Ethics or other company policies.

**Personal Use**

Limited personal use of company email is permitted, provided it does not interfere with job duties, violate any company policies, or consume excessive company resources. Permitted personal use includes:

*   Registering for personal development classes or community meetups that may be beneficial.
*   Sending occasional, brief emails to friends and family, provided no confidential information is disclosed and the emails do not constitute spam.
*   Downloading safe and appropriate personal use content, such as guides or ebooks, provided it does not pose a security risk.

**Email Security**

Email is a common vector for security threats. Employees must take proactive measures to protect their accounts and company data:

*   **Password Management:** Set strong, unique passwords for your company email account. Passwords must be a minimum of eight characters and include a combination of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols. Avoid using easily guessable personal information (e.g., birthdays, names). Change passwords every four to six months.
*   **Phishing and Malware Awareness:** Be vigilant about emails containing potential malware or phishing attempts.
    *   Do not open attachments or click on links from unknown or suspicious senders, or if the content is inadequately explained.
    *   Be wary of clickbait titles or urgent requests for personal information.
    *   Verify the sender's identity and email address to ensure legitimacy.
    *   Look for stylistic red flags such as grammar mistakes, excessive punctuation, or inconsistent formatting.
*   **Reporting Suspicious Emails:** If you receive an email you suspect is unsafe or malicious, do not open it. Forward it to the IT Security department at [IT Security Email Address] for investigation.
*   **Anti-Malware Software:** Ensure your company-issued devices have up-to-date anti-malware software installed and running.

**Email Signature**

Acme Corp encourages employees to use a professional email signature that represents the company well. For employees who interact with external parties, a standardized signature is required. The standard format is as follows:

[Employee Name]
[Employee Title]
Acme Corp
[Company Website Link]
[Company Phone Number]
[Company Address]

Company logos, work-related images, and approved links may be included. Employees unsure about creating or updating their signature should consult with their direct supervisor or the IT department.

**Monitoring of Corporate Emails**

Acme Corp reserves the right to monitor the use of its corporate email system to ensure compliance with this policy, protect company assets, and maintain network security. Employees should have no expectation of privacy when using the company email system.

**Disciplinary Consequences**

Employees who fail to adhere to this email usage policy will be subject to disciplinary action, which may include, but is not limited to:

*   Verbal or written warnings.
*   Suspension of email privileges.
*   Termination of employment.

Examples of violations that may lead to disciplinary action include:

*   Using company email to send confidential information without authorization.
*   Sending inappropriate, offensive, or harassing emails to coworkers, clients, or partners.
*   Using company email for any unlawful activity.
*   Repeatedly violating security protocols.
