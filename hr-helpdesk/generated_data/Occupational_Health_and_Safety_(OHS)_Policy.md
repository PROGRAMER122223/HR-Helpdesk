### 1. Purpose

Acme Corp is committed to fostering a flexible and productive work environment. This Remote Work Policy outlines the guidelines and procedures for employees who are approved to work remotely, either on a full-time or hybrid basis. The policy aims to ensure continued productivity, maintain data security, and support employee well-being while leveraging the benefits of remote work.

### 2. Scope

This policy applies to all full-time and part-time employees of Acme Corp who are approved to work remotely. It covers employees working from home, co-working spaces, or other approved remote locations. This policy does not apply to employees whose roles inherently require their physical presence at an Acme Corp facility.

### 3. Policy Guidelines

#### 3.1. Eligibility for Remote Work

Eligibility for remote work will be determined based on several factors, including:
*   **Job Role Suitability:** The nature of the employee's role and whether it can be effectively performed remotely without impacting productivity, collaboration, or client service.
*   **Performance:** Employees must have a consistent record of meeting or exceeding performance expectations.
*   **Technology and Infrastructure:** Employees must have access to a reliable internet connection and a suitable, secure workspace.
*   **Managerial Approval:** All remote work arrangements require the approval of the employee's direct manager and may require further approval from department heads or HR, depending on the arrangement.

#### 3.2. Types of Remote Work Arrangements

Acme Corp recognizes the following types of remote work arrangements:
*   **Full-Time Remote:** Employees who work exclusively from a remote location and are not expected to regularly attend an Acme Corp office.
*   **Hybrid Remote:** Employees who split their work time between an Acme Corp office and a remote location. Specific schedules will be agreed upon by the employee and their manager.

#### 3.3. Workspace and Equipment

*   **Workspace:** Employees are responsible for maintaining a safe, ergonomic, and distraction-free workspace at their remote location.
*   **Company-Provided Equipment:** Acme Corp will provide necessary equipment (e.g., laptop, monitor, peripherals) for employees working remotely. This equipment remains the property of Acme Corp and must be used primarily for business purposes.
*   **Personal Equipment:** If employees use personal equipment for work, they must ensure it meets Acme Corp's security standards and is protected by appropriate security software.
*   **Internet Connectivity:** Employees are responsible for ensuring reliable internet connectivity at their remote work location. Acme Corp may provide a stipend to offset internet costs, as outlined in the Compensation section.

#### 3.4. Data Security and Confidentiality

*   **Compliance:** All remote employees must adhere to Acme Corp's Data Protection Policy, Information Security Policy, and any other relevant policies regarding data handling and confidentiality.
*   **Secure Networks:** Employees must use secure, password-protected Wi-Fi networks for accessing company systems and data. Public or unsecured networks should be avoided for sensitive work.
*   **Device Security:** Company-issued devices must be protected with strong passwords and kept secure. Employees must report any loss or theft of company equipment immediately to the IT department.
*   **Confidential Information:** Employees must take all necessary precautions to protect confidential company information from unauthorized access or disclosure.

#### 3.5. Work Hours and Availability

*   **Standard Work Hours:** Remote employees are expected to maintain their standard work hours as agreed upon with their manager, unless a flexible schedule is formally approved.
*   **Availability:** Employees must be available and responsive during their agreed-upon work hours. Managers will establish clear expectations for communication response times.
*   **Time Tracking:** All employees, including remote workers, must accurately record their work hours using Acme Corp's designated timekeeping system.

#### 3.6. Communication and Collaboration

*   **Regular Check-ins:** Managers will conduct regular check-ins with remote employees to discuss progress, provide feedback, and address any challenges.
*   **Collaboration Tools:** Employees are expected to utilize company-approved collaboration tools (e.g., video conferencing, instant messaging, project management software) effectively.
*   **Team Meetings:** Remote employees are expected to participate in virtual team meetings and other required company communications.

#### 3.7. Performance Management

*   **Performance Expectations:** Performance standards and expectations remain the same for remote employees as for in-office employees.
*   **Performance Reviews:** Remote employees will participate in regular performance reviews and feedback sessions.

#### 3.8. Compensation and Expenses

*   **Salary:** Salary and benefits will not be adversely affected by an approved remote work arrangement.
*   **Remote Work Stipend:** Acme Corp may provide a monthly stipend to eligible remote employees to help cover costs associated with remote work, such as internet services or a portion of utility bills. The amount and eligibility for this stipend will be determined by HR and communicated separately.
*   **Reimbursement:** Expenses incurred for remote work, such as office supplies or specific equipment, must be pre-approved by a manager and will be reimbursed in accordance with Acme Corp's Employee Business Expense Policy.

#### 3.9. Health and Safety

*   **Workspace Safety:** Employees are responsible for ensuring their remote workspace is safe and free from hazards. Acme Corp is not liable for injuries sustained in an employee's remote workspace, except where mandated by applicable labor laws.
*   **Ergonomics:** Employees are encouraged to set up their workspace ergonomically to prevent strain or injury. Resources and guidance may be provided by HR.

#### 3.10. Termination of Remote Work Arrangement

Acme Corp reserves the right to modify or terminate an employee's remote work arrangement at any time due to business needs, performance issues, or policy violations. Employees may also request to end their remote work arrangement, subject to manager and HR approval.

### 4. Reporting and Compliance

*   **Policy Adherence:** All employees working remotely are expected to adhere to this policy and all other Acme Corp policies.
*   **Reporting Concerns:** Any concerns or issues related to remote work should be reported to the employee's manager or the HR department.
*   **Violations:** Failure to comply with this policy may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment.
