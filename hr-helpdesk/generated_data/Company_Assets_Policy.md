## Acme Corp - Employee Handbook

### **Company Email Usage Policy**

**Policy Brief and Purpose**

The Acme Corp corporate email system is a vital tool for business communication. This policy outlines the acceptable and unacceptable uses of company email to ensure data security, protect company reputation, and maintain a productive work environment. It aims to safeguard confidential information, prevent breaches, and uphold technological integrity.

**Scope**

This policy applies to all Acme Corp employees, contractors, and any third parties who are assigned or granted access to a company email account. This includes individually assigned email addresses and those assigned to departments.

**Policy Components**

Acme Corp provides company email accounts to facilitate efficient business operations. While the primary use is for work-related communication, limited personal use is permitted under specific conditions. Employees must understand that all company email communications are subject to monitoring and review.

**Correct Use of Corporate Email**

Employees are permitted to use their company email for work-related purposes without significant limitations. This includes, but is not limited to:

*   Communicating with current and prospective clients, partners, and vendors.
*   Accessing necessary software and online services for job functions.
*   Sharing contact information for business purposes at conferences, corporate events, or career fairs.
*   Subscribing to industry-relevant newsletters, online services, or platforms that contribute to professional development.

**Inappropriate Use of Corporate Email**

As representatives of Acme Corp, employees must refrain from using company email for the following:

*   Sending insulting, discriminatory, or offensive content.
*   Registering for competitive services or products without explicit authorization.
*   Intentionally sending unsolicited bulk emails (spam), especially to colleagues.
*   Signing up for unreliable, illegal, suspect, or disreputable websites or services.
*   Sending emails containing unlawful marketing information or solicitations.
*   Engaging in any activity that violates Acme Corp's Code of Ethics or other company policies.

Acme Corp reserves the right to monitor all corporate email communications.

**Personal Use**

Limited personal use of company email is allowed, provided it does not interfere with job duties, violate any company policies, or compromise security. Permitted personal use includes:

*   Registering for personal development classes or meetups.
*   Sending occasional, non-confidential emails to friends and family.
*   Downloading safe and appropriate personal content, such as guides or ebooks.

**Email Security**

Email is a common vector for malware, phishing attacks, and data breaches. Employees must adhere to the following security practices:

*   **Strong Passwords:** Set strong, unique passwords for email accounts. Passwords must be a minimum of eight characters and include a combination of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols. Avoid using personal information (e.g., birthdays) or easily guessable patterns.
*   **Password Management:** Change email passwords every four to five months. Do not write down passwords in easily accessible locations.
*   **Attachment and Link Caution:** Do not open attachments or click on links from unknown or suspicious senders, or when the content is inadequately explained. Be wary of clickbait titles.
*   **Sender Verification:** Verify the legitimacy of senders by checking their email addresses and names carefully.
*   **Style Red Flags:** Be cautious of emails with grammatical errors, excessive use of exclamation marks, or inconsistent formatting.
*   **Reporting Suspicious Emails:** If an employee is uncertain about the safety of an email, they should contact the IT Security department immediately.
*   **Anti-Malware Updates:** Ensure anti-malware and antivirus software on company devices are kept up-to-date.

**Email Signature**

Employees are encouraged to use a professional email signature that represents Acme Corp well. The standard format is as follows:

[Employee Name]
[Employee Title], [Company Name with Link]
[Phone Number] [Company Address]

Company logos, work-related images, and approved links may be included. Employees can seek assistance from their direct supervisor or the IT department for setting up their email signature.

**Disciplinary Consequences**

Employees who fail to comply with this email usage policy will be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment. Examples of violations that may lead to disciplinary action include:

*   Unauthorized transmission of confidential company information.
*   Sending inappropriate, offensive, or harassing emails to colleagues, clients, or partners.
*   Using company email for any unlawful activity.
*   Repeatedly violating security protocols.
