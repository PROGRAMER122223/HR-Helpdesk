## Acme Corp - Employee Handbook

### **Company Email Usage Policy**

**Policy Brief and Purpose**

The Acme Corp corporate email system is a vital tool for internal and external communication, essential for our daily operations. This policy is designed to ensure employees understand the correct and appropriate use of their company email addresses. Its primary aims are to safeguard confidential company data from breaches, protect our corporate reputation, and maintain the integrity of our technological infrastructure.

**Scope**

This email usage policy applies to all employees, contractors, and any third parties who are assigned or granted access to Acme Corp company email accounts. This includes individually assigned email addresses and those assigned to departments.

**Policy Components**

Acme Corp provides corporate email accounts to facilitate efficient and professional communication. While the primary purpose is for company-related business, limited personal use is permitted, provided it adheres to the guidelines outlined below.

**Correct Use of Corporate Email**

Employees are permitted to use their company email for all work-related purposes without significant limitations. This includes, but is not limited to:

*   Communicating with current and prospective clients, partners, and vendors.
*   Accessing necessary software and services for business operations.
*   Sharing contact information at professional events, conferences, or career fairs for business purposes.
*   Subscribing to industry-relevant newsletters, online services, or platforms that contribute to professional development and job performance.

**Inappropriate Use of Corporate Email**

As company email users represent Acme Corp, they must refrain from the following actions:

*   Sending emails containing insulting, discriminatory, or offensive content.
*   Registering for competitive services or platforms without explicit authorization.
*   Intentionally sending unsolicited bulk emails (spam), especially to colleagues.
*   Signing up for unreliable, illegal, suspect, or disreputable websites or services.
*   Sending emails containing unlawful marketing information or solicitations.

Acme Corp reserves the right to monitor corporate email usage to ensure compliance with this policy and to protect company interests.

**Personal Use**

Limited personal use of company email is allowed, provided it does not interfere with job duties, company operations, or violate any other company policy. Examples of acceptable personal use include:

*   Registering for professional development classes or meetups that may be beneficial.
*   Sending occasional, brief emails to friends and family, provided no confidential information is disclosed and it does not constitute spam.
*   Downloading non-malicious guides, ebooks, or other content for personal use, provided it is safe and appropriate.

**Email Security**

Email is a common vector for malware, data breaches, and phishing attacks, which can compromise company reputation, security, and equipment. Employees must adhere to the following security measures:

*   **Password Strength:** Set strong passwords with a minimum of eight characters, including a combination of lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and symbols. Avoid using personal information (e.g., birthdays, names) or easily guessable patterns.
*   **Password Management:** Change email passwords every four to six months. Do not write down passwords in easily accessible locations.
*   **Phishing and Malware Awareness:** Be vigilant about emails containing potential malware or employing phishing techniques. Employees are instructed to:
    *   Avoid opening attachments or clicking on links from unknown or suspicious senders, or when the content is inadequately explained.
    *   Be cautious of clickbait titles or urgent requests for information.
    *   Verify the sender's identity and email address to ensure legitimacy.
    *   Look for stylistic red flags such as grammar mistakes, excessive use of exclamation marks, or inconsistent formatting.

If an employee is uncertain about the safety of a received email, they should contact the Acme Corp IT Security department immediately. Employees are also instructed to keep their anti-malware programs updated.

**Email Signature**

Acme Corp encourages employees to create professional email signatures that accurately represent the company. Signatures should include:

*   Employee Name
*   Employee Title
*   Company Name (with a link to the company website)
*   Company Phone Number
*   Company Address

Inclusion of company logos, work-related images, or approved links is permitted. Employees unsure about creating their signature should consult their direct supervisor or the IT department.

**Disciplinary Consequences**

Employees who fail to adhere to this email usage policy will be subject to disciplinary action, which may include, but is not limited to, verbal warnings, written warnings, suspension, or termination of employment. Examples of violations leading to disciplinary action include:

*   Using company email to send unauthorized confidential information.
*   Sending inappropriate, offensive, or harassing emails to coworkers, clients, or partners.
*   Using the corporate email address for any unlawful activity.
