## Acme Corp - Employee Handbook

### **Company Email Usage Policy**

**Policy Brief and Purpose**

The Acme Corp corporate email system is a vital tool for internal and external communication, essential for our daily operations. This policy is designed to ensure employees understand the correct and appropriate use of their company email addresses. The primary aims are to safeguard confidential company data from breaches, protect our corporate reputation, and maintain the integrity of our technological infrastructure.

**Scope**

This email usage policy applies to all employees, contractors, and any third parties who are assigned or granted access to Acme Corp company email accounts. This includes individually assigned email addresses and any departmental or shared mailboxes.

**Policy Components**

Acme Corp provides corporate email accounts to facilitate business-related communication. While the primary purpose is professional, limited personal use is permitted, provided it adheres to the guidelines outlined below and does not interfere with work responsibilities or compromise company security.

**Correct Use of Corporate Email**

Employees are permitted to use their company email for all work-related purposes. This includes, but is not limited to:

*   Communicating with current and prospective clients, partners, and vendors.
*   Accessing necessary software and services for job functions.
*   Sharing contact information for business purposes at conferences, corporate events, or career fairs.
*   Subscribing to industry-related newsletters, online services, or platforms that contribute to professional development and job performance.

**Inappropriate Use of Corporate Email**

As company email users represent Acme Corp, the following actions are strictly prohibited:

*   Sending or forwarding emails containing insulting, discriminatory, defamatory, or offensive content.
*   Registering for competitive services or products without explicit authorization.
*   Intentionally sending unsolicited bulk emails (spam) to internal or external recipients, especially colleagues.
*   Signing up for or accessing unreliable, illegal, suspect, or disreputable websites or services.
*   Sending emails containing unlawful marketing information, solicitations, or chain letters.
*   Using company email for personal financial gain or any illegal activity.

Acme Corp reserves the right to monitor corporate email usage to ensure compliance with this policy and to protect company assets and interests.

**Personal Use**

Limited personal use of company email is permitted, provided it is reasonable and does not violate any other company policies. This includes:

*   Registering for personal development classes, workshops, or meetups that may be beneficial.
*   Sending occasional personal emails to friends and family, provided no confidential information is disclosed and the volume does not constitute spam.
*   Downloading guides, ebooks, or other content for personal use, provided the source is safe and appropriate.

**Email Security**

Email is a common vector for malware, phishing attacks, and data breaches. Employees must take proactive measures to protect their accounts and company data:

*   **Password Strength:** Set strong passwords with a minimum of eight characters, including a combination of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols. Avoid using personal information (e.g., birthdays, names) or easily guessable patterns.
*   **Password Management:** Do not write down passwords in easily accessible locations. Change email passwords every four to six months.
*   **Phishing and Malware Awareness:** Be vigilant about emails containing suspicious attachments or links. Exercise caution with emails that have clickbait titles, poor grammar, excessive punctuation, or originate from unknown senders. Verify sender legitimacy before opening attachments or clicking links.
*   **Reporting Suspicious Emails:** If an employee is uncertain about the safety of an email, they should contact the Acme Corp IT Security department immediately for assistance.
*   **Anti-Malware Software:** Ensure that anti-malware and antivirus software on company devices are kept up-to-date.

**Email Signature**

Employees are encouraged to use a professional email signature that represents Acme Corp effectively. A standard signature format should be used, including:

*   Employee Name
*   Employee Title
*   Acme Corp (with a link to the company website)
*   Company Phone Number
*   Company Address

Images, company logos, and work-related videos or links may be included if they are professional and approved by the Marketing or IT department. Employees unsure about signature setup can seek assistance from their direct supervisor or the IT department.

**Disciplinary Consequences**

Employees who fail to adhere to this email usage policy will be subject to disciplinary action, which may include:

*   Verbal warning
*   Written warning
*   Suspension
*   Termination of employment

Examples of violations that may lead to disciplinary action, including termination, include:

*   Unauthorized transmission of confidential company information.
*   Sending inappropriate, offensive, or harassing emails to colleagues, clients, or partners.
*   Using the corporate email address for any unlawful activity.
