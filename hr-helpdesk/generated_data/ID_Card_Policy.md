### **Company Email Usage Policy**

**Policy Brief and Purpose**

The Company Email Usage Policy at Acme Corp is designed to guide employees on the appropriate and responsible use of their corporate email addresses. Recognizing that email is a critical tool for daily operations, this policy aims to clarify usage limitations, protect confidential company data, and safeguard our organizational reputation and technological assets.

**Scope**

This email usage policy applies to all employees, contractors, and any third parties who are assigned or granted access to Acme Corp company email accounts. This includes individually assigned email addresses and those assigned to departments.

**Policy Components**

Acme Corp provides company email as a vital communication tool to support employees in their professional roles. While the primary purpose is for company-related communications, employees are permitted limited personal use, provided it adheres to the guidelines outlined below. This policy defines both proper and improper use of corporate email.

**Correct Use of Corporate Email**

Employees of Acme Corp are permitted to use their company email for work-related purposes without significant limitations. Examples of appropriate use include:

*   Communicating with current or prospective clients, partners, and vendors.
*   Accessing necessary software and services for business operations.
*   Sharing contact information at professional conferences, corporate events, or career fairs for business networking.
*   Subscribing to industry-related newsletters, online services, or platforms that contribute to professional development and job performance.

**Inappropriate Use of Corporate Email**

As company email users represent Acme Corp, they must refrain from the following actions:

*   Sending insulting, discriminatory, or offensive content.
*   Registering for competitive services or products without explicit authorization.
*   Intentionally sending unsolicited bulk emails (spam), especially to colleagues.
*   Signing up for unreliable, illegal, suspect, or disreputable websites or services.
*   Sending emails containing unlawful marketing information or solicitations.

Acme Corp reserves the right to monitor corporate email usage to ensure compliance with this policy and to protect company interests.

**Personal Use**

Employees may use their corporate email for limited personal matters, provided these activities do not interfere with work responsibilities, violate company policy, or pose a security risk. Examples of acceptable personal use include:

*   Registering for professional development classes or meetups that may be beneficial.
*   Sending non-confidential emails to friends and family, ensuring no spamming occurs.
*   Downloading job-relevant guides, ebooks, or other content, provided they are from safe and reputable sources.

**Email Security**

Email is a common vector for malware, data breaches, and phishing attacks, which can compromise company reputation, security, and equipment. Employees must adhere to the following security measures:

*   **Strong Passwords:** Set strong passwords with a minimum of eight characters, including a combination of lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and symbols. Avoid using personal information (e.g., birthdays, names).
*   **Password Management:** Passwords should be memorable but not easily guessable. Writing down passwords is unsafe; if necessary, store them securely and destroy them once no longer needed.
*   **Password Changes:** Change email passwords every four to five months.
*   **Phishing and Malware Awareness:** Be vigilant about emails containing potential malware or employing phishing techniques. Employees are instructed to:
    *   Avoid opening attachments or clicking on links from unknown or suspicious senders, especially if the content is vague or unexpected.
    *   Be cautious of clickbait titles or urgent requests.
    *   Verify sender identities and email addresses to ensure legitimacy.
    *   Look for stylistic red flags such as grammar mistakes, excessive punctuation, or inconsistent formatting.

Employees facing difficulties in identifying a safe email should contact Acme Corp's IT Security specialists immediately. Employees are also requested to keep their anti-malware programs updated.

**Email Signature**

Acme Corp encourages employees to create professional email signatures that accurately represent the company. Sales and client-facing personnel should pay particular attention to their signatures. A standard signature format is recommended:

[Employee Name]
[Employee Title], [Company Name with Link]
[Phone Number] | [Company Address]

Company logos, work-related images, and approved links may be included. Employees unsure about signature setup can seek assistance from their direct supervisor or the IT department.

**Disciplinary Consequences**

Employees who fail to adhere to this email usage policy will be subject to disciplinary action, which may include termination of employment. Examples of violations leading to disciplinary action include:

*   Unauthorized transmission of confidential company information.
*   Sending inappropriate or offensive emails to colleagues, clients, or partners.
*   Using corporate email for any unlawful activity.
