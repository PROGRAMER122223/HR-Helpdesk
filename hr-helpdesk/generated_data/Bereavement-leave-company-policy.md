### **Company Email Usage Policy**

**Policy Brief and Purpose**

The Company Email Usage Policy at Acme Corp is designed to provide clear guidelines for employees on the appropriate use of their corporate email addresses. Recognizing that email is a critical tool for daily operations, this policy aims to safeguard confidential company data, protect our reputation, and ensure the security of our technological infrastructure.

**Scope**

This email usage policy applies to all employees, contractors, and third parties who are assigned or granted access to Acme Corp's email systems. This includes individually assigned email addresses and those assigned to departments.

**Policy Components**

Acme Corp provides corporate email as a valuable tool to facilitate efficient communication and support employees in their job functions. While the primary purpose is for company-related activities, limited personal use is permitted under specific conditions. This policy defines both proper and improper use of corporate email.

**Correct Use of Corporate Email**

Employees are permitted to use their company email for all work-related purposes. This includes, but is not limited to:

*   Communicating with current and prospective clients, partners, and vendors.
*   Accessing necessary software and online services required for job functions.
*   Sharing contact information at professional events, conferences, or career fairs for business purposes.
*   Subscribing to industry-relevant newsletters, online services, or platforms that contribute to professional development and job performance.

**Inappropriate Use of Corporate Email**

As representatives of Acme Corp, employees must refrain from using their corporate email for the following:

*   Sending insulting, discriminatory, or offensive content.
*   Registering for competitive services or products without explicit authorization.
*   Intentionally sending unsolicited bulk emails (spam), especially to colleagues.
*   Signing up for unreliable, illegal, suspect, or disreputable websites or services.
*   Sending emails containing unlawful marketing information or solicitations.

Acme Corp reserves the right to monitor corporate email usage to ensure compliance with this policy.

**Personal Use**

Limited personal use of company email is permitted, provided it does not interfere with job responsibilities or violate any other company policies. Permissible personal use includes:

*   Registering for personal development classes, workshops, or meetups that may be beneficial.
*   Sending occasional, brief emails to friends and family, provided no confidential information is disclosed and the emails do not constitute spam.
*   Downloading personal use content, such as guides or ebooks, provided the sources are safe and reputable.

**Email Security**

Email is a common vector for malware, data breaches, and phishing attacks, which can compromise company reputation, security, and equipment. Employees must adhere to the following security measures:

*   **Strong Passwords:** Set strong passwords with a minimum of eight characters, including a combination of lowercase and uppercase letters, numbers, and symbols. Avoid using personal information (e.g., birthdays) or easily guessable patterns.
*   **Password Management:** Change email passwords every four to five months. Do not write down passwords in easily accessible locations.
*   **Phishing and Malware Awareness:** Be vigilant about emails containing potential malware or employing phishing techniques. Employees are instructed to:
    *   Avoid opening attachments or clicking on links from unknown or suspicious senders, especially if the content is vague or unexpected.
    *   Be wary of clickbait titles or urgent requests.
    *   Verify the sender's identity and email address to ensure legitimacy.
    *   Look for stylistic red flags such as grammar mistakes, excessive punctuation, or unusual capitalization.
*   **Reporting Suspicious Emails:** If an employee is uncertain about the safety of an email, they should contact the IT Security department immediately for assistance.
*   **Anti-Malware Software:** Ensure that anti-malware programs are kept updated on all company devices.

**Email Signature**

Employees are encouraged to create professional email signatures that accurately represent Acme Corp. Signatures should include:

*   Employee Name
*   Employee Title
*   Company Name (with a link to the company website)
*   Company Phone Number
*   Company Address

Optional elements may include company logos or relevant work-related links, subject to IT department approval. Employees unsure about signature formatting can seek guidance from their direct supervisor or the IT department.

**Disciplinary Consequences**

Employees who fail to adhere to this email usage policy will be subject to disciplinary action, which may include, but is not limited to, termination of employment. Examples of violations that may lead to disciplinary action include:

*   Unauthorized transmission of confidential company information.
*   Sending inappropriate, offensive, or harassing emails to colleagues, clients, or partners.
*   Using the corporate email address for any unlawful activity.
