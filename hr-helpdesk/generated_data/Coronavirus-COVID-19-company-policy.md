### **Company Email Usage Policy**

**Policy Brief and Purpose**

The Company Email Usage Policy at Acme Corp is designed to ensure that employees understand the appropriate and responsible use of their corporate email addresses. As a critical communication tool for daily operations, this policy aims to safeguard the company's confidential data, protect its reputation, and maintain the integrity of its technological infrastructure.

**Scope**

This email usage policy applies to all employees, contractors, and third parties who are assigned or granted access to Acme Corp's company email system. This includes individually assigned email addresses and departmental email accounts.

**Policy Components**

Acme Corp provides corporate email as a valuable tool to facilitate business operations. While the primary purpose is for company-related communications, limited personal use is permitted under specific conditions. This policy defines both proper and improper use of corporate email.

**Correct Use of Corporate Email**

Employees of Acme Corp are permitted to use their company email for work-related purposes without significant limitations. This includes, but is not limited to:

*   Communicating with current and prospective clients, partners, and vendors.
*   Accessing necessary software and services for business operations.
*   Sharing contact information at professional events for business purposes.
*   Subscribing to industry-relevant newsletters, online services, or platforms that contribute to professional development and job performance.

**Inappropriate Use of Corporate Email**

As corporate email users represent Acme Corp, they must refrain from the following actions:

*   Sending insulting, discriminatory, or offensive content.
*   Registering for competitive services or products without explicit authorization.
*   Intentionally sending unsolicited bulk emails (spam), especially to colleagues.
*   Signing up for unreliable, illegal, suspect, or disreputable websites or services.
*   Sending emails containing unlawful marketing information or solicitations.

Acme Corp reserves the right to monitor corporate email usage.

**Personal Use**

Employees may use their corporate email for limited personal matters, provided it does not interfere with work responsibilities or violate any company policies. Permitted personal use includes:

*   Registering for professional development classes or meetups that may be beneficial.
*   Sending occasional emails to friends and family, ensuring no confidential information is disclosed and that it does not constitute spam.
*   Downloading safe and appropriate content for personal use, such as guides or ebooks, provided it does not pose a security risk.

**Email Security**

Email is a common vector for viruses, data breaches, hacker attacks, and other malware. These threats can compromise Acme Corp's reputation, security, and operational integrity. Employees must adhere to the following security measures:

*   **Strong Passwords:** Set strong passwords with a minimum of eight characters, including a combination of lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and symbols. Avoid using personal information (e.g., birthdays) or easily guessable patterns.
*   **Password Management:** Change email passwords every four to six months. Do not write down passwords in an insecure manner.
*   **Phishing and Malware Awareness:** Be vigilant about emails containing potential malware or employing phishing techniques.
    *   Do not open attachments or click on links from unknown or suspicious senders, or when the content is inadequately explained.
    *   Be cautious of clickbait titles or urgent requests.
    *   Verify the sender's identity and email address to ensure legitimacy.
    *   Look for stylistic red flags such as grammar mistakes, excessive use of exclamation marks, or all-caps text.
*   **Reporting Suspicious Emails:** If an employee is uncertain about the safety of a received email, they should contact the Acme Corp IT Security department immediately.
*   **Anti-Malware Software:** Ensure that anti-malware programs are kept updated on all company-issued devices.

**Email Signature**

Acme Corp encourages employees to create professional email signatures that accurately represent the company. Salespeople and executives who interact with customers or partners should pay particular attention to their email closings. An example of a professional signature is:

[Employee Name]
[Employee Title], [Company Name with Link]
[Phone Number] | [Company Address]

Company logos, work-related images, and approved links may be included in email signatures. Employees can seek assistance from their direct supervisor or the IT department for signature setup.

**Disciplinary Consequences**

Employees who fail to adhere to this email usage policy will be subject to disciplinary action, which may include verbal warnings, written warnings, suspension, or termination of employment, depending on the severity and frequency of the violation. Examples of violations leading to disciplinary action include:

*   Unauthorized transmission of confidential company information.
*   Sending inappropriate or offensive emails to colleagues, clients, or partners.
*   Using corporate email for any unlawful activity.
