Acme Corp is committed to fostering a productive, flexible, and inclusive work environment. This Remote Work Policy outlines the guidelines and expectations for employees who are approved to work remotely. The policy aims to ensure continued operational efficiency, maintain data security, and support employee well-being while enabling remote work arrangements.

### 2. Scope

This policy applies to all full-time and part-time employees of Acme Corp who are approved for a remote work arrangement. This includes employees working from home, co-working spaces, or other locations outside of Acme Corp's designated office premises. This policy does not apply to employees whose roles inherently require their physical presence at an Acme Corp office or client site.

### 3. Policy Guidelines

**3.1. Eligibility for Remote Work:**

*   **Role Suitability:** Eligibility for remote work will be determined based on the nature of the employee's role and responsibilities. Roles that can be performed effectively with minimal need for physical presence, collaboration tools, and secure remote access may be considered.
*   **Performance Standards:** Employees must consistently meet or exceed performance expectations and demonstrate a strong track record of reliability, self-discipline, and effective communication.
*   **Managerial Approval:** All remote work arrangements require the explicit approval of the employee's direct manager and may require further approval from department heads or HR, depending on the arrangement.
*   **Remote Work Agreement:** Approved remote employees will be required to sign a Remote Work Agreement, which will detail specific terms, conditions, and expectations.

**3.2. Remote Work Environment:**

*   **Dedicated Workspace:** Employees are responsible for establishing and maintaining a safe, ergonomic, and distraction-free workspace that is conducive to productivity.
*   **Internet Connectivity:** Reliable and secure high-speed internet access is mandatory for remote work. Employees are responsible for ensuring their internet service meets the company's requirements.
*   **Data Security and Confidentiality:** Remote employees must strictly adhere to Acme Corp's Data Protection and Cybersecurity Policies. This includes using company-provided equipment (if applicable), secure network connections, and safeguarding all confidential company information.

**3.3. Work Hours and Availability:**

*   **Standard Work Hours:** Remote employees are expected to maintain their standard work hours as agreed upon with their manager, unless an alternative flexible schedule is formally approved.
*   **Availability:** Employees must be readily available and responsive during their agreed-upon work hours via company-approved communication channels (e.g., email, instant messaging, video conferencing).
*   **Time Tracking:** All employees, regardless of work location, must accurately record their working hours using Acme Corp's designated timekeeping system.

**3.4. Communication and Collaboration:**

*   **Proactive Communication:** Remote employees are expected to communicate proactively with their managers and team members regarding their work progress, availability, and any potential challenges.
*   **Utilizing Tools:** Employees must effectively utilize company-provided collaboration and communication tools to stay connected with colleagues and participate in team activities.
*   **Virtual Meetings:** Attendance and active participation in virtual meetings are expected as required by managers.

**3.5. Equipment and Resources:**

*   **Company-Provided Equipment:** If Acme Corp provides equipment (e.g., laptop, monitor), employees are responsible for its care, security, and proper use. Equipment must be returned upon termination of employment or the remote work arrangement.
*   **Personal Equipment:** If employees use personal equipment for work, they must ensure it meets Acme Corp's security and compatibility standards. Acme Corp is not responsible for the maintenance or repair of personal equipment.
*   **Reimbursement:** Expenses related to remote work, such as internet service or home office supplies, will be addressed according to Acme Corp's Employee Business Expense Policy.

**3.6. Performance Management:**

*   **Performance Expectations:** Performance standards and expectations for remote employees are the same as for in-office employees.
*   **Regular Check-ins:** Managers will conduct regular check-ins and performance reviews with remote employees to monitor progress, provide feedback, and address any concerns.

### 5. Termination of Remote Work Arrangement

Acme Corp reserves the right to modify or terminate an employee's remote work arrangement at any time due to business needs, performance issues, policy violations, or changes in role responsibilities. Employees may also request to end their remote work arrangement by providing advance notice to their manager and HR.

### 6. Compliance and Non-Retaliation

*   **Policy Adherence:** All employees approved for remote work must comply with this policy and all other applicable Acme Corp policies.
*   **Non-Retaliation:** Acme Corp prohibits retaliation against any employee for raising concerns or seeking clarification regarding this policy.
