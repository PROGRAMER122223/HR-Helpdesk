---

### 1. Purpose

Acme Corp is committed to fostering a flexible and productive work environment that supports employee well-being and business continuity. This Remote Work Policy outlines the guidelines and procedures for employees who are approved to work remotely, either on a full-time or hybrid basis. The policy aims to ensure that remote work arrangements are managed effectively, maintaining productivity, collaboration, security, and compliance with all applicable laws and regulations in India.

### 2. Scope

This policy applies to all full-time and part-time employees of Acme Corp who are approved for remote work arrangements. This includes employees working from home, co-working spaces, or other locations outside of Acme Corp's primary office facilities. This policy does not apply to employees whose roles inherently require their physical presence at an Acme Corp facility for the majority of their work duties, unless a specific hybrid arrangement is approved.

### 3. Policy Guidelines

#### 3.1. Eligibility for Remote Work

Eligibility for remote work will be determined based on several factors, including but not limited to:

*   **Job Role Suitability:** The nature of the employee's role and whether it can be effectively performed remotely without compromising productivity, collaboration, or security.
*   **Performance:** Employees must have a consistent record of satisfactory performance and demonstrate the ability to work independently and manage their time effectively.
*   **Technology and Infrastructure:** Employees must have access to a reliable internet connection and a suitable, secure workspace at their remote location.
*   **Team and Business Needs:** The impact of the remote work arrangement on team dynamics, client service, and overall business operations.

#### 3.2. Types of Remote Work Arrangements

Acme Corp recognizes the following types of remote work arrangements:

*   **Full Remote:** Employees who work exclusively from a location outside of an Acme Corp office.
*   **Hybrid Remote:** Employees who split their work time between an Acme Corp office and an approved remote location. Specific schedules and expectations for office attendance will be agreed upon with the employee's manager.

#### 3.3. Approval Process

1.  **Request Submission:** Employees interested in a remote work arrangement must submit a formal request to their direct manager, outlining the proposed arrangement (full remote or hybrid), the intended remote work location, and justification.
2.  **Managerial Review:** Managers will review the request, considering the eligibility criteria outlined in Section 3.1 and the impact on team operations.
3.  **HR Review and Approval:** Approved requests will be forwarded to the Human Resources (HR) department for final review and approval. HR will ensure compliance with legal requirements and company policy.
4.  **Formal Agreement:** Upon approval, the employee and their manager will sign a Remote Work Agreement, detailing the terms and conditions of the arrangement, including work hours, communication expectations, and security protocols.

#### 3.4. Workspace and Equipment

*   **Workspace:** Employees are responsible for maintaining a safe, ergonomic, and distraction-free workspace at their remote location. Acme Corp is not responsible for injuries sustained in the remote workspace, except as mandated by Indian labor laws.
*   **Equipment:** Acme Corp will provide necessary company-owned equipment (e.g., laptop, peripherals) for remote work. Employees are responsible for the care and security of company equipment. Personal devices used for work must comply with Acme Corp's IT security policies.
*   **Internet Connectivity:** Employees are responsible for ensuring reliable internet connectivity at their remote location. Acme Corp may provide a stipend to offset internet costs, as outlined in Section 3.7.

#### 3.5. Work Hours and Availability

*   **Standard Work Hours:** Remote employees are expected to adhere to their agreed-upon work hours, which should align with standard business hours in India or the employee's designated time zone, to facilitate collaboration.
*   **Availability:** Employees must be readily available and responsive during their scheduled work hours via company-approved communication channels (e.g., email, instant messaging, video conferencing).
*   **Time Tracking:** All employees, regardless of work location, must accurately record their working hours using Acme Corp's designated timekeeping system. Overtime must be pre-approved by a manager.

#### 3.6. Communication and Collaboration

*   **Regular Check-ins:** Managers will conduct regular check-ins with remote employees to discuss progress, provide feedback, and address any challenges.
*   **Team Collaboration:** Remote employees are expected to actively participate in team meetings and collaborative activities, utilizing company-provided communication and collaboration tools.
*   **Performance Management:** Performance expectations and evaluation processes remain the same for remote and in-office employees.

#### 3.7. Compensation and Expenses

*   **Salary:** Compensation will not be affected by a remote work arrangement, provided the employee continues to meet their job responsibilities.
*   **Stipend:** Acme Corp may provide a monthly stipend to eligible remote employees to help cover expenses such as internet connectivity and utilities. The amount and eligibility for this stipend will be determined by HR and communicated separately.
*   **Reimbursement:** Expenses incurred for business-related activities while working remotely (e.g., travel for approved meetings) will be reimbursed in accordance with Acme Corp's Travel and Expense Policy.

#### 3.8. Data Security and Confidentiality

*   **Compliance:** Remote employees must strictly adhere to Acme Corp's Data Protection and Information Security policies.
*   **Secure Networks:** Employees must use secure, password-protected internet connections and avoid using public Wi-Fi for accessing company systems and sensitive data.
*   **Confidential Information:** All confidential company information, client data, and intellectual property must be protected at all times. Remote workspaces should be secured to prevent unauthorized access.
*   **Company Equipment:** Company-issued equipment must be used for business purposes only and protected from loss, theft, or damage.

#### 3.9. Health and Safety

Employees are responsible for ensuring their remote workspace is safe and conducive to work. While Acme Corp is not liable for remote workspace conditions, employees should report any work-related injuries or hazards to HR immediately.

### 4. Policy Violations

Failure to comply with this Remote Work Policy may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment. This includes, but is not limited to, unauthorized remote work, failure to maintain productivity, security breaches, or misuse of company equipment.

### 5. Policy Review and Amendments

This policy will be reviewed annually by the HR department and may be amended or updated as necessary to reflect changes in business needs, technology, or legal requirements in India. Employees will be notified of any significant changes.
