### **Company Email Usage Policy**

**POLICY BRIEF AND PURPOSE**

The Acme Corp corporate email system is a vital tool for internal and external communication. This policy is designed to ensure that all employees understand the appropriate and inappropriate uses of their company-assigned email addresses. The primary aims are to protect Acme Corp's confidential data, maintain its reputation, and ensure the efficient and secure use of its technological resources.

**SCOPE**

This email usage policy applies to all employees, contractors, and any other individuals who are assigned or granted access to Acme Corp's email system. This includes individually assigned email addresses and any departmental or shared email accounts.

**POLICY COMPONENTS**

Acme Corp provides corporate email accounts to facilitate business operations and communication. While the primary purpose is for company-related activities, limited personal use is permitted under specific conditions. However, employees must always remember that they represent Acme Corp when using their company email and must conduct themselves accordingly.

**Correct Use of Corporate Email**

Employees of Acme Corp are permitted to use their company email for all work-related purposes. This includes, but is not limited to:

*   Communicating with current and prospective clients, partners, and vendors.
*   Accessing necessary software and services for business operations.
*   Sharing contact information for business purposes at conferences, corporate events, or networking opportunities.
*   Subscribing to industry-related newsletters, online services, or platforms that contribute to professional development and job performance.

**Inappropriate Use of Corporate Email**

When using their corporate email, employees are representing Acme Corp. Therefore, they must not:

*   Send or forward emails containing insulting, discriminatory, defamatory, or offensive content.
*   Register for competitive services or products without explicit authorization.
*   Intentionally send unsolicited bulk emails (spam) to others, especially coworkers.
*   Sign up for or access unreliable, illegal, suspect, or disreputable websites or services.
*   Send emails containing unlawful marketing information, solicitations, or chain letters.
*   Use company email for personal gain or any activity that violates company policies or laws.

Acme Corp reserves the right to monitor the use of its corporate email system to ensure compliance with this policy and to protect its assets and reputation.

**Personal Use**

Limited personal use of company email is permitted, provided it does not interfere with job responsibilities, violate any other company policy, or consume excessive company resources. Examples of acceptable personal use include:

*   Registering for personal development classes or meetups that may be beneficial.
*   Sending occasional emails to friends and family, provided no confidential information is disclosed and the emails do not constitute spam.
*   Downloading safe and appropriate content for personal use, such as guides or ebooks, ensuring no malware is introduced.

**Email Security**

Email is a common vector for security threats, including viruses, malware, phishing attempts, and data breaches. Employees must take proactive measures to protect their accounts and Acme Corp's data:

*   **Strong Passwords:** Set and maintain strong passwords for email accounts. Passwords must be a minimum of eight characters and include a combination of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols. Avoid using personal information (e.g., birthdays, names) or easily guessable patterns.
*   **Password Changes:** Change email passwords every four to six months.
*   **Phishing Awareness:** Be vigilant about suspicious emails. Employees should:
    *   Not open attachments or click on links from unknown or untrusted senders, or when the content is inadequately explained.
    *   Be cautious of clickbait titles or urgent requests for personal information.
    *   Verify the sender's identity and email address to ensure legitimacy.
    *   Look for stylistic red flags such as grammar mistakes, excessive punctuation, or inconsistent formatting.
*   **Reporting Suspicious Emails:** If an employee is uncertain about the safety of an email, they should contact the Acme Corp IT Security department immediately for assistance.
*   **Anti-Malware:** Ensure that anti-malware and antivirus software on company devices are kept updated.

**Email Signature**

Employees are encouraged to use a professional email signature that accurately represents Acme Corp and their role. A standard signature format will be provided, which may include:

*   Employee Name
*   Employee Title
*   Acme Corp (with a link to the company website)
*   Contact Phone Number
*   Company Address

Company logos, work-related images, and approved links may be included. Employees can seek assistance from their direct supervisor or the IT department for setting up their email signature.

**DISCIPLINARY CONSEQUENCES**

Employees who fail to adhere to this email usage policy will be subject to disciplinary action, which may include, but is not limited to, verbal warnings, written warnings, suspension, or termination of employment. Examples of violations that may lead to disciplinary action include:

*   Using company email to send confidential information without authorization.
*   Sending inappropriate, offensive, or harassing emails to coworkers, clients, or partners.
*   Using the corporate email address for any unlawful activity.
*   Repeatedly violating security protocols, leading to a breach.
