## Acme Corp - Employee Handbook

### **Company Email Usage Policy**

**Policy Brief and Purpose**

The Acme Corp corporate email system is a vital tool for business communication. This policy outlines the acceptable and unacceptable uses of company email to ensure data security, protect company reputation, and maintain a productive work environment. It aims to safeguard confidential information, prevent breaches, and uphold technological integrity.

**Scope**

This policy applies to all Acme Corp employees, contractors, and any third parties who are assigned or granted access to a company email account. This includes individually assigned email addresses and departmental email accounts.

**Policy Components**

Acme Corp provides company email accounts to facilitate efficient business operations. While the primary use is for work-related communication, limited personal use is permitted under specific conditions.

**Correct Use of Corporate Email**

Employees are permitted to use their company email for all company-related purposes. This includes, but is not limited to:

*   Communicating with current and prospective clients, partners, and vendors.
*   Accessing necessary software and services for work-related tasks.
*   Sharing contact information for business purposes at conferences, corporate events, or career fairs.
*   Subscribing to industry-relevant newsletters, online services, or platforms that contribute to professional development and job performance.

**Inappropriate Use of Corporate Email**

As company email users represent Acme Corp, the following uses are strictly prohibited:

*   Sending insulting, discriminatory, harassing, or offensive content.
*   Registering for competitive services or products without explicit authorization.
*   Intentionally sending unsolicited bulk emails (spam), especially to colleagues.
*   Signing up for unreliable, illegal, suspect, or disreputable websites or services.
*   Sending emails containing unlawful marketing information or solicitations.
*   Using company email for personal financial gain or any illegal activity.

Acme Corp reserves the right to monitor all company email communications.

**Personal Use**

Limited personal use of company email is allowed, provided it does not interfere with work responsibilities or violate any other company policies. Permissible personal use includes:

*   Registering for professional development classes or meetups that may be beneficial.
*   Sending occasional, brief emails to friends and family, provided no confidential information is disclosed and it does not constitute spam.
*   Downloading safe and appropriate content for personal use, such as guides or ebooks, provided it does not pose a security risk.

**Email Security**

Email is a common vector for malware, phishing attacks, and data breaches. Employees must adhere to the following security measures:

*   **Password Strength:** Set strong, unique passwords for your company email account. Passwords must be a minimum of eight characters and include a combination of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols. Avoid using personal information (e.g., birthdays, names).
*   **Password Management:** Do not write down passwords in easily accessible locations. Change your email password every four to five months.
*   **Attachment and Link Caution:** Do not open attachments or click on links in emails from unknown or suspicious senders, or when the content is inadequately explained. Be wary of clickbait titles or urgent requests.
*   **Sender Verification:** Always verify the sender's identity and email address to ensure legitimacy. Look for inconsistencies in sender names or email addresses.
*   **Style Red Flags:** Be cautious of emails containing grammatical errors, excessive use of exclamation marks, or all-capital letters, as these can be indicators of phishing attempts.
*   **Reporting Suspicious Emails:** If you encounter an email you suspect is unsafe or malicious, do not open it. Forward it to the IT Security department immediately for analysis.
*   **Anti-Malware:** Ensure your anti-malware software is up-to-date and actively running.

**Email Signature**

Employees are encouraged to use a professional email signature that represents Acme Corp well. For roles that involve external communication, a standardized signature is recommended. An example of a professional signature is:

[Employee Name]
[Employee Title]
Acme Corp | [Company Website Link]
[Company Phone Number] | [Company Address]

Company logos, work-related images, and approved links may be included in email signatures. Consult with your direct supervisor or the IT department for guidance on creating and implementing professional email signatures.

**Disciplinary Consequences**

Employees who fail to adhere to this email usage policy will be subject to disciplinary action, which may include:

*   Verbal warning
*   Written warning
*   Suspension
*   Termination of employment

Examples of violations that may lead to disciplinary action, including termination, include:

*   Unauthorized transmission of confidential company information.
*   Sending inappropriate, offensive, or harassing emails to colleagues, clients, or partners.
*   Using the corporate email address for any unlawful activity.
