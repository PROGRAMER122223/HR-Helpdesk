**Policy Number:** HR-REM-001
**Effective Date:** October 26, 2023
**Version:** 1.0

---

### 1. Purpose

Acme Corp is committed to fostering a flexible and productive work environment. This Remote Work Policy outlines the guidelines and procedures for employees who are approved to work remotely, either on a full-time or hybrid basis. The policy aims to ensure continued operational efficiency, maintain data security, promote employee well-being, and support work-life balance while upholding Acme Corp's commitment to its business objectives.

### 2. Scope

This policy applies to all full-time and part-time employees of Acme Corp who are approved for remote work arrangements. This includes employees working from home, co-working spaces, or other locations outside of Acme Corp's primary office facilities. This policy does not apply to employees whose roles inherently require their physical presence at an Acme Corp facility (e.g., on-site IT support, facilities management).

### 3. Policy Guidelines

#### 3.1. Eligibility for Remote Work

Eligibility for remote work will be determined based on several factors, including but not limited to:

*   **Job Role Suitability:** The nature of the employee's role and responsibilities must be conducive to remote work without negatively impacting productivity, collaboration, or service delivery.
*   **Performance:** Employees must have a consistent record of satisfactory performance and demonstrate the ability to work independently and manage their time effectively.
*   **Technology and Infrastructure:** Employees must have access to a reliable internet connection and a suitable, secure workspace that meets Acme Corp's security and data protection standards.
*   **Managerial Approval:** All remote work arrangements require the explicit approval of the employee's direct manager and may require further approval from department heads or HR, depending on the arrangement.

#### 3.2. Types of Remote Work Arrangements

Acme Corp recognizes the following types of remote work arrangements:

*   **Full-Time Remote:** Employees who work exclusively from a location outside of an Acme Corp office.
*   **Hybrid Remote:** Employees who split their work time between an Acme Corp office and an approved remote location. The specific schedule (e.g., days in office vs. days remote) will be agreed upon by the employee and their manager.

#### 3.3. Remote Work Environment and Responsibilities

Employees approved for remote work are responsible for:

*   **Dedicated Workspace:** Maintaining a safe, ergonomic, and distraction-free workspace.
*   **Internet Connectivity:** Ensuring a stable and secure internet connection sufficient for job duties, including video conferencing.
*   **Data Security and Confidentiality:** Adhering strictly to Acme Corp's Data Protection and Cybersecurity policies. This includes securing company equipment, using secure networks, and protecting confidential information.
*   **Availability and Communication:** Being available and responsive during agreed-upon core working hours. Maintaining proactive communication with managers and team members through approved channels.
*   **Productivity:** Maintaining or exceeding the productivity and performance standards expected of their role.

#### 3.4. Equipment and Technology

*   **Company-Provided Equipment:** Acme Corp will provide necessary equipment (e.g., laptops, monitors) where required. Employees are responsible for the care and security of company-issued equipment.
*   **Personal Equipment:** If personal equipment is used for remote work, it must meet Acme Corp's security and compatibility standards. Employees are responsible for the maintenance and security of their personal devices.
*   **Technical Support:** Employees should contact the IT Helpdesk for technical support related to company-provided equipment and systems.

#### 3.5. Working Hours and Availability

*   **Core Working Hours:** Employees are expected to be available and working during core business hours, which will be defined by department managers to ensure team collaboration and client service.
*   **Flexibility:** While remote work offers flexibility, employees must coordinate their schedules with their managers to ensure team needs are met and that availability for meetings and collaboration is maintained.
*   **Time Tracking:** All employees, regardless of work location, must accurately record their working hours using Acme Corp's designated timekeeping system.

#### 3.6. Data Protection and Security

*   **Compliance:** Remote work must comply with all applicable data protection laws and regulations in India, including the Personal Data Protection Bill (when enacted).
*   **Secure Networks:** Employees must use secure, password-protected Wi-Fi networks. Public Wi-Fi networks should be avoided for accessing sensitive company data.
*   **Device Security:** All devices used for remote work must be password-protected and have up-to-date antivirus software installed.
*   **Confidential Information:** Employees must take all necessary precautions to prevent unauthorized access, disclosure, or loss of confidential company information.

#### 3.7. Expenses and Reimbursement

*   Acme Corp will not typically reimburse for general home office expenses such as internet service, utilities, or furniture unless explicitly stated in a separate agreement or policy.
*   Specific business-related expenses incurred while working remotely (e.g., necessary travel for meetings) will be reimbursed in accordance with Acme Corp's Employee Business Expense Policy.

### 4. Application and Approval Process

1.  **Discussion with Manager:** Employees interested in a remote work arrangement should discuss their request with their direct manager, outlining the proposed arrangement and how it aligns with their role and team objectives.
2.  **Formal Request:** If the manager supports the request, the employee must submit a formal Remote Work Request Form to their manager and HR.
3.  **Review and Approval:** The manager and HR department will review the request based on the eligibility criteria outlined in this policy. Approval may be contingent on specific conditions or a trial period.
4.  **Remote Work Agreement:** Approved employees will be required to sign a Remote Work Agreement, which will detail the terms and conditions of their remote work arrangement.

### 5. Performance Management

Performance expectations and evaluation processes remain the same for remote employees as for in-office employees. Managers will focus on results, productivity, and adherence to company policies and procedures. Regular check-ins and feedback sessions will be conducted.

### 6. Policy Violations

Failure to comply with this Remote Work Policy, including but not limited to security breaches, misuse of company equipment, or failure to maintain productivity, may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment. Remote work arrangements may be revoked at any time if deemed necessary by Acme Corp.

### 7. Policy Review

This policy will be reviewed annually by the HR department and updated as necessary to reflect changes in business needs, technology, and legal requirements.
