## Acme Corp - Employee Handbook Policy

### **Company Email Usage Policy**

**Policy Brief and Purpose**

The Company Email Usage Policy at Acme Corp is designed to guide employees on the appropriate and responsible use of their corporate email addresses. Recognizing that company email is a vital tool for daily operations, this policy aims to clarify its intended use, outline limitations, and protect Acme Corp's confidential data, reputation, and technological assets.

**Scope**

This email usage policy applies to all employees, contractors, and third parties who are assigned or granted access to Acme Corp's company email system. This includes individually assigned email addresses and those assigned to departments.

**Policy Components**

Acme Corp provides company email as a professional communication tool to facilitate business operations. While primarily intended for company-related purposes, limited personal use is permitted under specific conditions. This policy defines both appropriate and inappropriate uses of company email.

**Correct Use of Corporate Email**

Employees of Acme Corp are permitted to use their company email for work-related purposes without significant limitations. This includes, but is not limited to:

*   Communicating with current and prospective clients, partners, and vendors.
*   Accessing necessary software and services for job functions.
*   Sharing contact information for business purposes at conferences, corporate events, or career fairs.
*   Subscribing to newsletters, online services, or other platforms that contribute to professional development and job performance.

**Inappropriate Use of Corporate Email**

As company email users represent Acme Corp, they must refrain from the following actions:

*   Sending insulting, discriminatory, or offensive content.
*   Registering for competitive services without explicit authorization.
*   Intentionally sending unsolicited bulk emails (spam), especially to colleagues.
*   Signing up for unreliable, illegal, suspect, or disreputable websites or services.
*   Sending emails containing unlawful marketing information or solicitations.

Acme Corp reserves the right to monitor corporate email usage.

**Personal Use**

Limited personal use of company email is permitted, provided it does not interfere with job responsibilities or violate any other company policies. Examples of acceptable personal use include:

*   Registering for classes or meetups that may be beneficial for personal growth.
*   Sending emails to friends and family, provided no confidential information is disclosed and the emails do not constitute spam.
*   Downloading guides, ebooks, or other content for personal use, as long as they are deemed safe and appropriate.

**Email Security**

Company email accounts are a potential vector for viruses, data breaches, hacker attacks, and other malware, which can harm Acme Corp's reputation, legal standing, and equipment security. Employees must adhere to the following security measures:

*   **Password Strength:** Set strong passwords with a minimum of eight characters, including a combination of lowercase and uppercase letters, numbers, and symbols. Avoid using personal information (e.g., birthdays) or easily guessable patterns.
*   **Password Management:** Do not write down passwords in an insecure manner. Change email passwords every four to six months.
*   **Phishing and Malware Awareness:** Be vigilant about emails containing potential malware or employing phishing techniques. Employees are instructed to:
    *   Avoid opening attachments or clicking on links from unknown or suspicious senders, especially if the content is inadequately explained.
    *   Be cautious of clickbait titles or urgent requests.
    *   Verify the sender's identity and email address to ensure legitimacy.
    *   Look for stylistic red flags such as grammar mistakes, excessive use of exclamation marks, or inconsistent formatting.
*   **Reporting Suspicious Emails:** If an employee is uncertain about the safety of a received email, they should contact the Acme Corp IT Security department immediately.
*   **Anti-Malware Updates:** Ensure anti-malware programs are kept updated.

**Email Signature**

Acme Corp encourages employees to create professional email signatures that represent the company well. For employees who interact with customers or partners, particular attention should be paid to email closings. A standard signature format is as follows:

[Employee Name]
[Employee Title]
Acme Corp | [Company Website Link]
[Phone Number] | [Company Address]

Images, company logos, and work-related videos or links may be included in email signatures, subject to IT department approval. Employees unsure about creating their signature should consult their direct supervisor or the IT department.

**Disciplinary Consequences**

Employees who fail to adhere to this email usage policy will be subject to disciplinary action, which may include termination of employment. Examples of violations that could lead to disciplinary action include, but are not limited to:

*   Using company email to send unauthorized confidential information.
*   Sending inappropriate, offensive, or harassing emails to coworkers, clients, or partners.
*   Using the corporate email address for any unlawful activity.
