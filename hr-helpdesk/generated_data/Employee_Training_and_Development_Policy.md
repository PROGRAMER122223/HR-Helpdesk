### **Company Email Usage Policy**

**Policy Brief and Purpose**

The Acme Corp email policy is designed to guide employees on the appropriate use of their corporate email accounts. As a critical communication tool, corporate email is provided for business-related purposes. This policy aims to safeguard company data, protect our reputation, and ensure the efficient use of technological resources.

**Scope**

This policy applies to all Acme Corp employees, contractors, and any third parties who are assigned or granted access to company email accounts. This includes individually assigned email addresses and those assigned to departments.

**Policy Components**

Acme Corp email accounts are provided to facilitate business operations. While we encourage efficient communication, employees must adhere to the guidelines outlined below to ensure responsible usage.

**Correct Use of Corporate Email**

Employees are permitted to use their company email for work-related communications without limitation. This includes, but is not limited to:

*   Communicating with current and prospective clients, partners, and vendors.
*   Accessing necessary software and online services for business purposes.
*   Sharing contact information at professional events for business networking.
*   Subscribing to industry-related newsletters or online services that enhance job performance or professional growth.

**Inappropriate Use of Corporate Email**

As representatives of Acme Corp, employees must refrain from using their corporate email for the following:

*   Sending insulting, discriminatory, or offensive content.
*   Registering for competitive services or platforms without explicit authorization.
*   Intentionally sending unsolicited bulk emails (spam), especially to colleagues.
*   Signing up for unreliable, illegal, suspect, or disreputable websites or services.
*   Sending emails containing unlawful marketing information or solicitations.
*   Engaging in any activity that violates Acme Corp's Code of Ethics or other company policies.

Acme Corp reserves the right to monitor corporate email usage to ensure compliance with this policy and to protect company interests.

**Personal Use**

Limited personal use of company email is permitted, provided it does not interfere with job responsibilities, violate any company policies, or consume excessive company resources. Examples of acceptable personal use include:

*   Registering for personal development classes or professional meetups.
*   Sending occasional, non-confidential emails to friends and family.
*   Downloading non-malicious content that is safe and appropriate for personal use.

**Email Security**

Email is a common vector for security threats, including malware, phishing attempts, and data breaches. Employees must take proactive measures to maintain email security:

*   **Password Management:**
    *   Set strong passwords with a minimum of eight characters, including a combination of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols.
    *   Avoid using personal information (e.g., birthdays, names) in passwords.
    *   Change email passwords every four to five months.
    *   Do not share email passwords with anyone.
*   **Phishing and Malware Awareness:**
    *   Exercise caution with emails containing unexpected attachments or links, especially if the content is unclear or suspicious.
    *   Be wary of clickbait titles or urgent requests for personal information.
    *   Verify the sender's identity and email address to ensure legitimacy.
    *   Look for stylistic red flags such as grammar mistakes, excessive punctuation, or unusual capitalization.
*   **Reporting Suspicious Emails:** If an employee is uncertain about the safety of an email, they should contact the Acme Corp IT Security department immediately for assistance.
*   **Anti-Malware Software:** Ensure that anti-malware programs on company devices are kept up-to-date.

**Email Signature**

Employees are encouraged to use a professional email signature that represents Acme Corp effectively. A standard signature format should include:

*   [Employee Name]
*   [Employee Title]
*   Acme Corp [Company Website Link]
*   [Company Phone Number]
*   [Company Address]

Company logos, work-related images, and approved links may be included. Employees can seek assistance from their direct supervisor or the IT department for signature setup.

**Disciplinary Consequences**

Employees who fail to adhere to this email usage policy will be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment. Examples of violations that may lead to disciplinary action include:

*   Unauthorized transmission of confidential company information.
*   Sending inappropriate, offensive, or harassing emails to colleagues, clients, or partners.
*   Using corporate email for any unlawful activity.
