## Acme Corp - Employee Handbook

### **Company Email Usage Policy**

**Policy Brief and Purpose**

The Acme Corp corporate email system is a vital tool for business communication. This policy outlines the acceptable and unacceptable uses of company email to ensure data security, protect company reputation, and maintain a productive work environment. It aims to safeguard confidential information, prevent breaches, and uphold technological integrity.

**Scope**

This policy applies to all Acme Corp employees, contractors, and any third parties who are assigned or granted access to a company email account. This includes individually assigned email addresses and those assigned to departments.

**Policy Components**

Acme Corp provides corporate email accounts to facilitate efficient business operations. While primarily intended for work-related communication, limited personal use is permitted under specific conditions. Employees must understand that their use of company email represents Acme Corp and must adhere to professional standards.

**Correct Use of Corporate Email**

Employees are permitted to use their company email for all work-related purposes. This includes, but is not limited to:

*   Communicating with current and prospective clients, partners, and vendors.
*   Accessing necessary software and services for job functions.
*   Sharing contact information for business purposes at conferences, corporate events, or career fairs.
*   Subscribing to industry-relevant newsletters, online services, or platforms that contribute to professional development and job performance.

**Inappropriate Use of Corporate Email**

When using their corporate email, employees represent Acme Corp. Therefore, the following uses are strictly prohibited:

*   Sending insulting, discriminatory, defamatory, or offensive content.
*   Registering for competitive services or products without explicit authorization.
*   Intentionally sending unsolicited bulk emails (spam), especially to colleagues.
*   Signing up for unreliable, illegal, suspect, or disreputable websites or services.
*   Sending emails containing unlawful marketing information or solicitations.
*   Using company email for personal gain or any activity that violates company policy or applicable laws.

Acme Corp reserves the right to monitor corporate email usage to ensure compliance with this policy and to protect company assets and interests.

**Personal Use**

Limited personal use of company email is permitted, provided it does not interfere with job responsibilities, violate any company policies, or consume excessive company resources. Permitted personal use includes:

*   Registering for classes or meetups that may be beneficial for personal growth.
*   Sending non-confidential emails to friends and family, provided it does not constitute spam or violate other company policies.
*   Downloading safe and appropriate content for personal use, such as guides or ebooks, provided it does not pose a security risk.

**Email Security**

Email is a common vector for malware, phishing attacks, and data breaches. Employees must adhere to the following security practices:

*   **Strong Passwords:** Set strong, unique passwords for your company email account. Passwords must be at least eight characters long and include a combination of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols. Avoid using personal information or easily guessable patterns.
*   **Password Changes:** Change your email password every four to five months.
*   **Attachment and Link Caution:** Do not open attachments or click on links in emails from unknown or suspicious senders, or when the content is inadequately explained or seems unusual. Be wary of clickbait titles or urgent requests.
*   **Sender Verification:** Always verify the sender's identity and email address to ensure legitimacy. Look for inconsistencies in sender names or email domains.
*   **Style Red Flags:** Be cautious of emails containing grammatical errors, excessive use of exclamation marks, or all-capital letters, as these can be indicators of phishing attempts.
*   **Reporting Suspicious Emails:** If you encounter an email you suspect is unsafe or malicious, do not open it. Forward it to the IT Security department at [IT Security Email Address] for investigation.
*   **Anti-Malware Updates:** Ensure your anti-malware software is up-to-date.

**Email Signature**

Employees are encouraged to use a professional email signature that represents Acme Corp well. The standard signature format is as follows:

[Employee Name]
[Employee Title]
Acme Corp | [Company Website Link]
[Company Phone Number] | [Company Address]

Company logos, work-related images, and approved links may be included in the signature. Employees unsure about setting up their signature should consult their direct supervisor or the Office Manager.

**Disciplinary Consequences**

Employees who fail to adhere to this email usage policy will be subject to disciplinary action, which may include:

*   Verbal warning
*   Written warning
*   Suspension
*   Termination of employment

Examples of violations that may lead to disciplinary action, including termination, include:

*   Unauthorized transmission of confidential company information.
*   Sending inappropriate, offensive, or harassing emails to colleagues, clients, or partners.
*   Using the corporate email address for any unlawful activity.
*   Repeatedly violating security protocols.
