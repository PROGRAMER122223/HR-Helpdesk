### **Company Email Usage Policy**

**Policy Brief and Purpose**

The Company Email Usage Policy at Acme Corp is designed to guide employees on the appropriate and effective use of their corporate email addresses. Recognizing that email is a critical tool for daily operations, this policy aims to clarify its intended use, limitations, and the importance of safeguarding company data, reputation, and technological assets.

**Scope**

This email usage policy applies to all employees, contractors, and any third parties who are assigned or granted access to Acme Corp's email system. This includes individually assigned email addresses and those assigned to departments.

**Policy Components**

Acme Corp provides corporate email as a vital communication tool to support employees in their professional responsibilities. While the primary purpose is for company-related activities, limited personal use is permitted under specific conditions. This policy defines both proper and improper use of the corporate email system.

**Correct Use of Corporate Email**

Employees of Acme Corp are permitted to use their company email for work-related purposes without significant limitations. This includes, but is not limited to:

*   Communicating with current and prospective clients, partners, and vendors.
*   Accessing necessary software and services for business operations.
*   Sharing contact information for business purposes at conferences, corporate events, or career fairs.
*   Subscribing to industry-relevant newsletters, online services, or platforms that contribute to professional development and job performance.

**Inappropriate Use of Corporate Email**

As corporate email users represent Acme Corp, they must refrain from the following actions:

*   Sending insulting, discriminatory, or offensive content.
*   Registering for competitive services or products without explicit authorization.
*   Intentionally sending unsolicited bulk emails (spam), especially to colleagues.
*   Signing up for unreliable, illegal, suspect, or disreputable websites or services.
*   Sending emails containing unlawful marketing information or solicitations.

Acme Corp reserves the right to monitor corporate email usage to ensure compliance with this policy and to protect company interests.

**Personal Use**

Limited personal use of corporate email is allowed, provided it does not interfere with job duties, company operations, or violate any other company policies. Permitted personal use includes:

*   Registering for classes or meetups that may be beneficial for personal growth.
*   Sending non-confidential emails to friends and family, provided they do not constitute spam or violate other policies.
*   Downloading safe and appropriate content for personal use, such as guides or ebooks, provided it does not pose a security risk.

**Email Security**

Email is a common vector for malware, data breaches, and phishing attacks, which can compromise company reputation, security, and equipment. Employees must adhere to the following security measures:

*   **Strong Passwords:** Set strong passwords with a minimum of eight characters, including a combination of lowercase and uppercase letters, numbers, and symbols. Avoid using personal information (e.g., birthdays) or easily guessable patterns.
*   **Password Management:** Change email passwords every four to five months. Do not write down passwords in easily accessible locations.
*   **Phishing and Malware Awareness:** Be vigilant about emails containing potential malware or employing phishing techniques. Employees are instructed to:
    *   Avoid opening attachments or clicking on links from unknown or suspicious senders, or when the content is inadequately explained.
    *   Be cautious of clickbait titles or urgent requests.
    *   Verify the legitimacy of senders by checking names and email addresses carefully.
    *   Look for stylistic red flags such as grammar mistakes, excessive use of exclamation marks, or inconsistent formatting.
*   **Reporting Suspicious Emails:** If an employee is uncertain about the safety of an email, they should contact the IT Security department immediately for assistance.
*   **Anti-Malware Software:** Ensure that anti-malware programs are kept updated on all company devices.

**Email Signature**

Acme Corp encourages employees to create professional email signatures that represent the company effectively. For employees who interact with customers or partners, particular attention should be paid to the signature's content and format. An example of a professional email signature is:

[Employee Name]
[Employee Title]
Acme Corp | [Company Website Link]
[Company Phone Number] | [Company Address]

Employees may include company logos, work-related images, and links in their email signatures. Assistance with setting up email signatures can be obtained from the IT department or their direct supervisor.

**Disciplinary Consequences**

Employees who fail to comply with this email usage policy will be subject to disciplinary action, which may include termination of employment. Examples of violations that could lead to disciplinary action include, but are not limited to:

*   Using company email to send confidential information without authorization.
*   Sending inappropriate, offensive, or harassing emails to coworkers, clients, or partners.
*   Using the corporate email address for any unlawful activity.
