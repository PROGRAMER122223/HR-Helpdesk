## Acme Corp - Employee Handbook Policy: Remote Work

**1. Policy Brief and Purpose**

Acme Corp is committed to fostering a flexible and productive work environment. This Remote Work Policy outlines the guidelines and procedures for employees who are approved to work from a location other than a designated Acme Corp office. The purpose of this policy is to ensure that remote work arrangements support business objectives, maintain productivity, uphold data security, and promote employee well-being, while complying with all applicable Indian labor laws and regulations.

**2. Scope**

This policy applies to all full-time and part-time employees of Acme Corp who are approved for a remote work arrangement. This includes employees working from home, co-working spaces, or other approved remote locations within India. This policy does not apply to employees who are temporarily working remotely due to specific company-approved circumstances (e.g., short-term project needs) unless otherwise specified.

**3. Eligibility for Remote Work**

3.1. **Role Suitability:** Eligibility for remote work will be assessed based on the nature of the employee's role and responsibilities. Roles that can be performed effectively with minimal need for physical presence at an Acme Corp office and that do not pose significant security or operational risks may be considered for remote work.

3.2. **Employee Performance:** Employees must demonstrate a consistent record of satisfactory performance, reliability, and adherence to company policies.

3.3. **Managerial Approval:** All remote work arrangements require the explicit approval of the employee's direct manager and the relevant department head.

3.4. **Infrastructure and Security:** Employees must have a dedicated, safe, and distraction-free workspace with a reliable internet connection that meets Acme Corp's security standards.

**4. Types of Remote Work Arrangements**

Acme Corp recognizes various remote work models:

4.1. **Full Remote:** Employees who work exclusively from an approved remote location.

4.2. **Hybrid Remote:** Employees who split their work time between an approved remote location and an Acme Corp office. The specific schedule (e.g., number of days in office vs. remote) will be agreed upon by the employee and their manager.

**5. Application and Approval Process**

5.1. **Request Submission:** Employees interested in a remote work arrangement must submit a formal written request to their manager, outlining the proposed remote work location, the desired arrangement (full remote or hybrid), and how they will maintain productivity and connectivity.

5.2. **Managerial Review:** Managers will review the request, considering role suitability, employee performance, team needs, and infrastructure requirements.

5.3. **Departmental and HR Approval:** Approved requests will be forwarded to the relevant department head and the Human Resources (HR) department for final review and approval.

5.4. **Remote Work Agreement:** Upon approval, the employee and Acme Corp will enter into a formal Remote Work Agreement, detailing the terms and conditions of the arrangement, including work hours, communication expectations, data security protocols, and duration.
