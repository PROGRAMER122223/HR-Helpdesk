### **Company Email Usage Policy**

**Policy Brief and Purpose**

The Company Email Usage Policy at Acme Corp is designed to guide employees on the appropriate and responsible use of their corporate email addresses. Recognizing that email is a critical tool for daily operations, this policy aims to clarify the limitations and expectations associated with its use. The primary objectives are to safeguard confidential company data from breaches, protect Acme Corp's reputation, and ensure the secure use of our technological assets.

**Scope**

This email usage policy applies to all employees, contractors, and any other individuals who are assigned or granted access to Acme Corp's email systems. This includes individually assigned email addresses as well as those assigned to departments or teams.

**Policy Components**

Acme Corp provides corporate email as a valuable communication tool to facilitate business operations. While the primary purpose is for company-related activities, employees are permitted limited personal use, provided it does not interfere with work responsibilities or violate any company policies. This policy defines both proper and improper use of corporate email.

**Correct Use of Corporate Email**

Employees of Acme Corp are permitted to use their company email for work-related purposes without significant limitations. Examples of appropriate use include:

*   Communicating with current or prospective clients, partners, and vendors.
*   Accessing necessary software and services for business operations.
*   Sharing contact information at professional conferences, corporate events, or career fairs for business networking.
*   Subscribing to industry-relevant newsletters, online services, or platforms that contribute to professional development and job performance.

**Inappropriate Use of Corporate Email**

As corporate email users represent Acme Corp, they must refrain from the following actions:

*   Sending insulting, discriminatory, or offensive content.
*   Registering for competitive services or platforms without explicit authorization.
*   Intentionally sending unsolicited bulk emails (spam), especially to colleagues.
*   Signing up for unreliable, illegal, suspect, or disreputable websites or services.
*   Sending emails containing unlawful marketing information or solicitations.

Acme Corp reserves the right to monitor corporate email usage to ensure compliance with this policy and to protect company assets and interests.

**Personal Use**

Employees may use their corporate email for limited personal matters, provided that such use is infrequent, does not interfere with work duties, and adheres to the following guidelines:

*   Registering for personal development classes, workshops, or meetups that may be beneficial.
*   Sending non-confidential emails to friends and family, ensuring no spamming occurs.
*   Downloading personal use content, such as guides or ebooks, provided they are from safe and reputable sources.

**Email Security**

Email remains a common vector for malware, confidentiality breaches, and phishing attacks, which can compromise Acme Corp's reputation, legal standing, and technological infrastructure. Employees must adhere to the following security measures:

*   **Password Strength:** Set strong passwords with a minimum of eight characters, including a combination of lowercase and uppercase letters, numbers, and symbols. Avoid using easily guessable personal information (e.g., birthdays, names).
*   **Password Management:** Do not write down passwords in easily accessible locations. Change email passwords every four to five months.
*   **Phishing and Malware Awareness:** Be vigilant about emails containing potential malware or employing phishing techniques.
    *   Do not open attachments or click on links in emails with inadequately explained content or suspicious origins.
    *   Be cautious of clickbait titles or urgent requests.
    *   Verify the sender's identity and email address to ensure legitimacy.
    *   Look for stylistic red flags such as grammar mistakes, excessive use of exclamation marks, or inconsistent formatting.

Employees facing difficulties in identifying a safe email should contact the IT Security department immediately. Employees are also instructed to keep their anti-malware programs updated.

**Email Signature**

Acme Corp encourages employees to create professional email signatures that accurately represent the company. Salespeople and executives who interact with customers or partners should pay particular attention to their email closings. A standard signature format is as follows:

[Employee Name]
[Employee Title]
Acme Corp | [Company Website Link]
[Company Phone Number] | [Company Address]

Employees may include company logos, work-related images, or links in their signatures. Assistance with signature setup can be obtained from the IT department or direct supervisors.

**Disciplinary Consequences**

Employees who fail to adhere to this email usage policy will be subject to disciplinary action, which may include termination of employment. Examples of violations leading to disciplinary action include:

*   Unauthorized transmission of confidential company information.
*   Sending inappropriate or offensive emails to colleagues, clients, or partners.
*   Using corporate email for any unlawful activity.
