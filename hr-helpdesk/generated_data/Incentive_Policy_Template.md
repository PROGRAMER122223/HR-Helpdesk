### **1. Purpose**

Acme Corp is committed to fostering a productive, flexible, and inclusive work environment. This Remote Work Policy outlines the guidelines and expectations for employees who are approved to work remotely, either on a full-time or hybrid basis. The policy aims to ensure continued operational efficiency, maintain data security, promote employee well-being, and support work-life balance while upholding Acme Corp's commitment to its employees and clients.

### **2. Scope**

This policy applies to all full-time and part-time employees of Acme Corp, regardless of their role or department, who are approved for remote work arrangements. This policy does not apply to independent contractors or temporary staff unless explicitly stated in their contractual agreement.

### **3. Policy Statement**

Acme Corp recognizes that remote work can offer significant benefits to both employees and the organization. Approved remote work arrangements are a privilege, not a right, and are granted based on the nature of the role, individual performance, and business needs. All remote work arrangements must comply with the terms outlined in this policy.

### **4. Eligibility for Remote Work**

Eligibility for remote work will be determined on a case-by-case basis and will consider the following factors:

*   **Role Suitability:** The nature of the employee's role and responsibilities must be conducive to remote work without negatively impacting productivity, collaboration, or service delivery. Roles requiring significant on-site presence, hands-on equipment interaction, or direct client interaction may not be suitable for full-time remote work.
*   **Employee Performance:** Employees must demonstrate a consistent record of satisfactory performance, reliability, and adherence to company policies.
*   **Technical Requirements:** Employees must have a suitable remote work environment, including a reliable internet connection, a dedicated and safe workspace, and access to necessary technology as provided or approved by Acme Corp.
*   **Business Needs:** The needs of the department, team, and the organization as a whole will be a primary consideration in approving remote work arrangements.

### **5. Types of Remote Work Arrangements**

Acme Corp supports the following remote work arrangements:

*   **Full-Time Remote:** Employees who work exclusively from a location other than an Acme Corp office.
*   **Hybrid Remote:** Employees who split their work time between an Acme Corp office and an approved remote location. The specific schedule (e.g., number of days in office vs. remote) will be agreed upon by the employee and their manager.

### **6. Application and Approval Process**

1.  **Request Submission:** Employees interested in a remote work arrangement must submit a formal "Remote Work Request Form" to their direct manager. This form will detail the proposed arrangement (full-time or hybrid), the remote work location, and the rationale for the request.
2.  **Manager Review:** The direct manager will review the request, considering the role's suitability, team dynamics, and operational requirements.
3.  **Department Head/Senior Management Approval:** If the manager supports the request, it will be forwarded to the relevant Department Head or Senior Management for further review and approval.
4.  **HR Review and Finalization:** The Human Resources (HR) department will review the request for policy compliance and finalize the approval. A formal "Remote Work Agreement" will be drafted and signed by the employee, manager, and HR.
5.  **Remote Work Agreement:** This agreement will outline the specific terms and conditions of the remote work arrangement, including work hours, communication expectations, equipment usage, data security protocols, and the duration of the arrangement.

### **7. Employee Responsibilities**

Employees approved for remote work are expected to:

*   **Maintain Productivity:** Meet all performance expectations and deadlines as if working in the office.
*   **Adhere to Work Hours:** Maintain agreed-upon work hours and be available during core business hours as defined by their department and manager.
*   **Communication:** Respond promptly to communications from managers, colleagues, and clients via approved channels (e.g., email, instant messaging, video conferencing). Proactively communicate availability and any potential disruptions.
*   **Data Security and Confidentiality:** Strictly adhere to Acme Corp's Data Protection and Cybersecurity Policies. This includes securing company equipment, using secure networks, protecting confidential information, and reporting any security incidents immediately.
*   **Workspace:** Maintain a safe, ergonomic, and distraction-free workspace that is conducive to productive work.
*   **Company Property:** Ensure the proper care and security of any company-issued equipment. Report any loss, damage, or theft immediately.
*   **Compliance:** Comply with all Acme Corp policies and procedures, including the Code of Conduct, Anti-Discrimination Policy, and any other relevant guidelines.
*   **Reporting:** Promptly report any issues that may affect their ability to work remotely, such as internet outages or equipment malfunctions.

### **8. Manager Responsibilities**

Managers of remote employees are responsible for:

*   **Performance Management:** Setting clear performance expectations, providing regular feedback, and conducting performance reviews consistent with in-office employees.
*   **Communication:** Ensuring regular and effective communication with remote team members.
*   **Team Cohesion:** Fostering a sense of team unity and inclusion among both remote and in-office employees.
*   **Resource Allocation:** Ensuring remote employees have the necessary tools and resources to perform their jobs effectively.
*   **Policy Adherence:** Monitoring compliance with this Remote Work Policy and addressing any violations promptly.

### **9. Equipment and Technology**

*   **Company-Provided Equipment:** Acme Corp will provide essential equipment (e.g., laptop, necessary software licenses) for remote work as deemed appropriate and necessary for the role.
*   **Employee-Owned Equipment:** If employees use their own devices, they must comply with Acme Corp's BYOD (Bring Your Own Device) Policy and ensure adequate security measures are in place.
*   **Internet Connectivity:** Employees are responsible for securing reliable high-speed internet access at their remote work location. Acme Corp may provide a stipend to offset internet costs, as outlined in the Employee Benefits and Perks Policy.
*   **Technical Support:** Employees can contact the IT Helpdesk for technical support related to company-issued equipment and software. Support for personal devices or home internet service is the employee's responsibility.

### **10. Data Security and Confidentiality**

Remote employees must strictly adhere to Acme Corp's Data Protection and Cybersecurity Policies. This includes:

*   Using secure Wi-Fi networks and VPN connections when accessing company resources.
*   Protecting company data from unauthorized access, disclosure, or loss.
*   Not storing sensitive company data on personal devices or unsecured cloud storage.
*   Reporting any suspected data breaches or security vulnerabilities immediately to the IT Security team.

### **11. Work Hours and Availability**

*   Remote employees are expected to work their standard contracted hours.
*   Core working hours, during which employees must be available and responsive, will be determined by department managers and communicated to the team.
*   Employees must keep their online status updated and inform their manager of any planned absences or unavailability during work hours.

### **12. Compensation and Benefits**

Remote work arrangements do not alter an employee's current compensation, benefits, or eligibility for promotions, unless otherwise specified in the Remote Work Agreement or other company policies.

### **13. Travel**

Employees working remotely are generally expected to travel to an Acme Corp office or other designated location for meetings, training, or other business purposes as required. Travel expenses will be reimbursed in accordance with the Company Travel Policy.

### **14. Review and Modification of Remote Work Arrangements**

Acme Corp reserves the right to review, modify, or terminate remote work arrangements at any time based on business needs, performance issues, or policy violations. Employees will be provided with reasonable notice of any changes to their remote work status.

### **15. Policy Violations**

Failure to comply with the terms of this Remote Work Policy, the Remote Work Agreement, or any other applicable company policies may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment.
