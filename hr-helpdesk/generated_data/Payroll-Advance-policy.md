## Acme Corp - Employee Handbook

### **Company Email Usage Policy**

**Policy Brief and Purpose**

The Acme Corp email policy is designed to guide employees on the appropriate use of their corporate email addresses. As a vital communication tool, corporate email is provided for company-related purposes. This policy aims to protect Acme Corp's confidential data, reputation, and technological assets by outlining acceptable and unacceptable uses of company email.

**Scope**

This email usage policy applies to all employees, contractors, and third parties who are assigned or granted access to Acme Corp's email system. This includes individually assigned email addresses and departmental email accounts.

**Policy Components**

Acme Corp's email system is a critical resource for business operations. While primarily intended for work-related communication, limited personal use is permitted under specific conditions. Employees must understand that their use of the company email system may be monitored.

**Correct Use of Corporate Email**

Employees are permitted to use their company email for all work-related activities. This includes, but is not limited to:

*   Communicating with current and prospective clients, partners, and vendors.
*   Accessing necessary software and online services for business purposes.
*   Sharing contact information for business networking at conferences, corporate events, or career fairs.
*   Subscribing to industry-related newsletters, online services, or platforms that contribute to professional development and job performance.

**Inappropriate Use of Corporate Email**

As representatives of Acme Corp, employees must refrain from using their company email for the following:

*   Sending insulting, discriminatory, or offensive content.
*   Registering for competitive services or products without explicit authorization.
*   Intentionally sending unsolicited bulk emails (spam), especially to colleagues.
*   Signing up for unreliable, illegal, suspect, or disreputable websites or services.
*   Sending emails containing unlawful marketing information or solicitations.
*   Disclosing confidential company information without proper authorization.

Acme Corp reserves the right to monitor corporate email communications to ensure compliance with this policy and to protect company interests.

**Personal Use**

Limited personal use of company email is permitted, provided it does not interfere with job responsibilities or violate any other company policies. Acceptable personal use includes:

*   Registering for educational classes or professional development meetups.
*   Sending occasional emails to friends and family, provided no confidential information is disclosed and the emails do not constitute spam.
*   Downloading job-related or generally safe and appropriate content, such as guides or ebooks.

**Email Security**

Email is a common vector for security threats, including viruses, data breaches, and phishing attacks. Employees must adhere to the following security measures:

*   **Password Strength:** Set strong passwords with a minimum of eight characters, including a combination of lowercase and uppercase letters, numbers, and symbols. Avoid using personal information (e.g., birthdays) or easily guessable patterns.
*   **Password Management:** Do not write down passwords. If absolutely necessary, store passwords securely and destroy them once no longer needed.
*   **Password Changes:** Change email passwords every four to five months.
*   **Phishing and Malware Awareness:** Be vigilant about emails containing potential malware or employing phishing techniques.
    *   Do not open attachments or click on links in emails with unclear or suspicious content.
    *   Be wary of clickbait titles or urgent requests.
    *   Verify the sender's identity and email address to ensure legitimacy.
    *   Look for stylistic red flags such as grammar mistakes, excessive punctuation, or inconsistent formatting.
*   **Reporting Suspicious Emails:** If an employee is uncertain about the safety of an email, they should contact the IT Security department immediately.
*   **Anti-Malware Updates:** Ensure anti-malware programs are kept up-to-date.

**Email Signature**

Employees are encouraged to use a professional email signature that represents Acme Corp well. For roles that involve external communication, such as sales or client-facing positions, a standardized signature format is recommended. An example of a professional email signature is:

[Employee Name]
[Employee Title], [Company Name with Link]
[Phone Number] [Company Address]

Company logos, work-related images, and approved links may be included in email signatures. Employees can seek assistance from their direct supervisor or the IT department for setting up their email signatures.

**Disciplinary Consequences**

Employees who fail to adhere to this email usage policy will be subject to disciplinary action, which may include:

*   Verbal warning
*   Written warning
*   Suspension
*   Termination of employment

Examples of violations that may lead to disciplinary action, including termination, include:

*   Unauthorized transmission of confidential company information.
*   Sending inappropriate, offensive, or harassing emails to colleagues, clients, or partners.
*   Using the corporate email address for any unlawful activity.
