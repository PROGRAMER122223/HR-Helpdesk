### 1. Purpose

Acme Corp is committed to fostering a flexible and productive work environment. This Remote Work Policy outlines the guidelines and procedures for employees who are approved to work remotely, either on a full-time or hybrid basis. The policy aims to ensure continued operational efficiency, maintain data security, and support employee well-being while working outside of the traditional office setting.

### 2. Scope

This policy applies to all full-time and part-time employees of Acme Corp who are approved for remote work arrangements. This includes employees working from home, co-working spaces, or other approved remote locations. This policy does not apply to employees who are required to be on-site for the nature of their role.

### 3. Definitions

*   **Remote Work:** Performing job duties from a location other than a designated Acme Corp office.
*   **Full-Time Remote:** An employee whose primary work location is remote and is not expected to regularly attend an Acme Corp office.
*   **Hybrid Remote:** An employee who splits their work time between a remote location and an Acme Corp office, based on an agreed-upon schedule.
*   **Remote Work Agreement:** A formal document outlining the terms and conditions of an employee's remote work arrangement, signed by the employee and their manager.
*   **Designated Workspace:** A safe, secure, and ergonomically sound area within the employee's remote location suitable for performing job duties.

### 4. Eligibility for Remote Work

Eligibility for remote work will be determined based on several factors, including but not limited to:

*   **Job Role Suitability:** The nature of the employee's role and whether it can be effectively performed remotely without negatively impacting productivity, collaboration, or client service.

### 5. Remote Work Arrangements

Acme Corp recognizes two primary types of remote work arrangements:

*   **Full-Time Remote:** Employees approved for full-time remote work will primarily perform their duties from an approved remote location. Occasional office visits may be required for specific meetings or events, as determined by management.
*   **Hybrid Remote:** Employees approved for hybrid remote work will work a predetermined schedule, splitting their time between a remote location and an Acme Corp office. The specific schedule will be agreed upon by the employee and their manager.

### 6. Application and Approval Process

1.  **Employee Request:** Employees interested in a remote work arrangement must discuss their interest with their direct manager.

3.  **Formal Application:** If deemed feasible, the employee will complete a Remote Work Application form, detailing their proposed work location, schedule, and confirmation of infrastructure.
4.  **Remote Work Agreement:** Upon approval by the manager and HR, a formal Remote Work Agreement will be drafted and signed by the employee, manager, and HR representative. This agreement will outline specific expectations, duration, and any conditions of the remote work arrangement.
5.  **Review:** Remote work arrangements will be reviewed periodically, at least annually, by the manager and HR to ensure continued suitability and compliance.
