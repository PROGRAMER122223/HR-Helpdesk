### **Company Email Usage Policy**

**Policy Brief and Purpose**

The Company Email Usage Policy at Acme Corp is designed to guide employees on the appropriate and effective use of their corporate email addresses. Recognizing that email is a critical tool for daily operations, this policy aims to clarify limitations, protect confidential company data, and safeguard our organizational reputation and technological assets.

**Scope**

This email usage policy applies to all employees, contractors, and any third parties who are assigned or granted access to Acme Corp's email system. This includes individually assigned email addresses as well as those assigned to departments.

**Policy Components**

Acme Corp provides corporate email as a vital communication tool to support employees in their professional responsibilities. While the primary use is for company-related purposes, limited personal use is permitted under specific conditions. This policy defines both proper and improper use of the corporate email system.

**Correct Use of Corporate Email**

Employees of Acme Corp are permitted to use their company email for work-related purposes without undue restriction. This includes, but is not limited to:

*   Communicating with current and prospective clients, partners, and vendors.
*   Accessing necessary software and services for job functions.
*   Sharing professional contact information at conferences, corporate events, or career fairs for business development.
*   Subscribing to industry-relevant newsletters, online services, or platforms that contribute to professional development and job performance.

**Inappropriate Use of Corporate Email**

As corporate email users represent Acme Corp, employees must refrain from the following actions:

*   Sending insulting, discriminatory, or offensive content.
*   Registering for competitive services or products without explicit authorization.
*   Intentionally sending unsolicited bulk emails (spam), especially to colleagues.
*   Signing up for unreliable, illegal, suspect, or disreputable websites or services.
*   Sending emails containing unlawful marketing information or solicitations.

Acme Corp reserves the right to monitor corporate email usage to ensure compliance with this policy and to protect company interests.

**Personal Use**

Limited personal use of corporate email is allowed, provided it does not interfere with job duties, company operations, or violate any other company policies. Permitted personal use includes:

*   Registering for classes, workshops, or meetups that may be beneficial for personal growth.
*   Sending non-confidential emails to friends and family, provided they do not constitute spam or violate other policies.
*   Downloading safe and appropriate guides, ebooks, or other content for personal use.

**Email Security**

Email is a common vector for malware, data breaches, and phishing attacks, which can compromise company reputation, security, and equipment. Employees must adhere to the following security practices:

*   **Password Strength:** Set strong passwords with a minimum of eight characters, including a combination of lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and symbols. Avoid using personal information (e.g., birthdays, names).
*   **Password Management:** Change email passwords every four to six months. Do not write down passwords in easily accessible locations.
*   **Phishing and Malware Awareness:** Be vigilant against emails containing malware or employing phishing techniques.
    *   Do not open attachments or click on links in emails with suspicious or inadequately explained content.
    *   Be wary of clickbait titles or urgent requests.
    *   Verify the sender's identity and email address to ensure legitimacy.
    *   Look for stylistic red flags such as grammar mistakes, excessive use of exclamation marks, or inconsistent formatting.
*   **Reporting Suspicious Emails:** If an employee is uncertain about the safety of an email, they should contact the Acme Corp IT Security department immediately.
*   **Anti-Malware Software:** Ensure that anti-malware programs on company devices are kept updated.

**Email Signature**

Employees are encouraged to use a professional email signature that represents Acme Corp effectively. Sales personnel and executives who interact with customers and partners should pay particular attention to their email signatures. A standard format will be provided, which may include:

[Employee Name]
[Employee Title], [Company Name with Link]
[Phone Number] | [Company Address]

Company logos, work-related images, and approved links may be included in email signatures. Employees can seek assistance from their direct supervisor or the IT department for signature setup.

**Disciplinary Consequences**

Employees who fail to adhere to this email usage policy will be subject to disciplinary action, which may include, but is not limited to, verbal warnings, written warnings, suspension, or termination of employment. Examples of violations leading to disciplinary action include:

*   Unauthorized transmission of confidential company information.
*   Sending inappropriate, offensive, or harassing emails to colleagues, clients, or partners.
*   Using the corporate email address for any unlawful activity.
