      "1. OVERVIEW\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Each employee at [Company Name] is responsible for punctual and consistent attendance. Employees should arrive on time, be prepared to work, and on schedule. Employees are also expected to stay at work for the whole of their shift. It is inconvenient to arrive late, leave early, or miss other scheduled hours, and it must be avoided.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This policy does not apply to FMLA-covered (FMLA - Family and Medical Leave Act) absences or leave taken as a reason\n",
      "\n",
      "able accommodation under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). They have their own policies that cover these exceptions.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "2. OBJECTIVE\n",
      "\n",
      "The goal of this policy is to lay out [Company Names] policies and processes for dealing with employee absences and tardiness in order to increase the company's efficiency and reduce unscheduled absences.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "3. ATTENDANCE INFRACTIONS CALCULATION\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Absent with calls - 1 Point \n",
      "\n",
      "Absent with no calls - 2 Points \n",
      "\n",
      "Tardy - ½ Point\n",
      "\n",
      "Early Departure - ½ Point\n",
      "\n",
      "Returning late from the lunch break - 1 Point (over 30 minutes)\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Employees are allowed a five-minute grace period at the start and end of each normal shift, as well as during breaks and lunch. Employees must report an absence following [process for reporting an absence]. Each day that an employee is missing, they must report it. If you do not call off one hour prior to your shift, you will be considered a no-call, no-show.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "5 points - Meeting with the manager/supervisor, possibly suspension\n",

      "6 points - The employee will be subjected to termination. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "A job desertion, or termination without warning, will be considered if an employee is a no call-no show for three or more days in a row.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Employees can ask HRs and managers for work absence exclusions. These must be approved on the basis of a case-by-case method.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "4. ABSENCES WITHOUT PAYMENT OR EXCUSE AND WITHOUT DISCIPLINARY ACTION\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Unpaid absences can be due to a variety of causes, including funerals, jury duty, sorrow, childbirth, a car accident, a medical appointment, and other unforeseen circumstances. In certain circumstances, employees must present paperwork to prove their absence.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "5. INABILITY TO CLOCK IN OR CLOCK OUT \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Employees are required to clock-in and clock-out in each shift. If there is an issue documenting a clock-in or clock-out, employees should contact a manager as soon as possible. Employees who fail to report to work on time or leave on time may risk disciplinary action, including termination.\n",

      "# Employee Punctuality and Absence Policy\n",
      "\n",
      "## 1. Introduction\n",
      "\n",
      "Acme Corp values the dedication and commitment of its employees. Punctual and consistent attendance is crucial for maintaining operational efficiency and ensuring seamless collaboration within our Information Technology environment. This policy outlines the expectations for employee attendance, reporting procedures for absences, and the consequences of non-compliance.\n",
      "\n",
      "This policy does not supersede or alter provisions related to legally protected leaves such as those under the Maternity Benefit Act, the Employees' State Insurance Act, or any other applicable Indian labor laws, nor does it affect accommodations provided under disability-related legislation.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 2. Purpose\n",
      "\n",
      "The objective of this policy is to establish clear guidelines and procedures for managing employee attendance, tardiness, and unscheduled absences. By adhering to these standards, Acme Corp aims to foster a productive work environment, minimize disruptions, and ensure fair and consistent application of attendance expectations.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 3. Attendance Expectations and Reporting\n",
      "\n",
      "Employees are expected to report for duty on time, be prepared to commence work at their scheduled start time, and remain at work for the duration of their shift. Arriving late, leaving early, or taking unauthorized breaks disrupts workflow and impacts team productivity.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 3.1 Reporting Absences\n",
      "\n",
      "Employees must notify their immediate supervisor or designated HR representative of any absence *prior* to their scheduled start time. This notification should be done through [Specify approved communication channel, e.g., email to manager and HR, specific HR portal, or phone call to a designated number].\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Notification Requirement:** For planned absences (e.g., pre-approved leave), employees must follow the company's leave application procedure. For unforeseen absences (e.g., illness), notification must be given as soon as practicable, and no later than one hour before the scheduled start of the shift.\n",
      "*   **Failure to Notify:** An absence without prior notification will be considered a \"No-Call, No-Show.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "### 3.2 Documentation for Absences\n",
      "\n",
      "For absences exceeding [Number, e.g., three] consecutive working days due to illness or injury, employees are required to submit a medical certificate from a registered medical practitioner. Similar documentation may be required for other types of absences, as determined by the HR department on a case-by-case basis.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 4. Tardiness and Early Departures\n",
      "\n",
      "Punctual arrival and departure are expected. While occasional minor delays may occur, consistent tardiness or early departures are subject to disciplinary action.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Grace Period:** A grace period of [Number, e.g., five] minutes is permitted for clocking in at the start of the shift and clocking out at the end of the shift. This grace period does not apply to returning from lunch or other breaks.\n",
      "*   **Reporting Issues:** Employees experiencing technical difficulties with the timekeeping system should immediately report the issue to their supervisor or the IT department.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 5. Disciplinary Actions for Attendance Infractions\n",
      "\n",
      "Acme Corp utilizes a progressive disciplinary approach to address attendance issues. Infractions are tracked over a rolling period of [Specify period, e.g., twelve months].\n",
      "\n",
      "### 5.1 Infraction Categories and Points\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Late Arrival (beyond grace period):** 0.5 points\n",
      "*   **Early Departure (without approval):** 0.5 points\n",
      "*   **Unapproved Absence (single instance):** 1 point\n",
      "*   **Unapproved Absence (consecutive days):** 2 points per day\n",
      "*   **No-Call, No-Show (single instance):** 2 points\n",
      "*   **No-Call, No-Show (consecutive days):** 3 points per day\n",
      "*   **Returning Late from Lunch/Break (beyond grace period):** 1 point\n",
      "\n",
      "### 5.2 Disciplinary Steps\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Accumulation of [Number, e.g., 3] points:** Verbal Warning\n",
      "*   **Accumulation of [Number, e.g., 5] points:** Written Warning\n",
      "*   **Accumulation of [Number, e.g., 7] points:** Final Written Warning and Performance Improvement Plan\n",
      "*   **Accumulation of [Number, e.g., 10] points or more:** Termination of Employment\n",
      "\n",
      "*Note: A \"No-Call, No-Show\" for [Number, e.g., three] consecutive working days may be considered job abandonment and result in immediate termination.*\n",
      "\n",
      "## 6. Approved Absences and Exceptions\n",
      "\n",
      "Certain absences are considered excused and do not accrue points under this policy, provided proper documentation and notification procedures are followed. These include:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Approved Paid Time Off (PTO) / Annual Leave:** As per company leave policy.\n",
      "*   **Approved Sick Leave:** Supported by a medical certificate where required.\n",
      "*   **Maternity Leave:** As per the Maternity Benefit Act.\n",
      "*   **Jury Duty:** Official summons required.\n",
      "*   **Bereavement Leave:** For immediate family members, as per company policy.\n",
      "*   **Other legally mandated leaves:** As per Indian labor laws.\n",
      "\n",
      "Employees requiring an absence for reasons not explicitly listed above should discuss their situation with their supervisor and HR. Such requests will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 7. Policy Review\n",
      "\n",
      "This policy will be reviewed periodically and may be updated by Acme Corp. Employees will be notified of any significant changes.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "**Disclaimer:** This policy is intended as a guideline for Acme Corp employees and is not an employment contract. It is subject to change at the discretion of Acme Corp. While this policy aims to align with relevant Indian labor laws, employees are encouraged to consult the official labor laws for comprehensive details.
