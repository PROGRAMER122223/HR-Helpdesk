# HR Helpdesk - RAG Project

For this project, HR documents are stored in a local folder. In production environments, these documents might be hosted on:

- Confluence
- Wiki pages
- Other enterprise document management systems

# What We're Building
- ChatGPT-like Interface: Interactive chat interface for users to ask questions
